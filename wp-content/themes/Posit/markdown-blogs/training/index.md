At RStudio, we want you to be effective R users. As well as [creating](http://rstudio.com/ide/) [great](http://ggplot2.org) [software](http://github.com/hadley/devtools), we want to make it easier for you to master R. To this end, we're very happy to announce our new [training offerings](http://rstudio.com/training).

We're kicking off with two public courses:

  * [Effective data visualisation](http://rstudio.com/training/curriculum/effective-data-visualization.html) and [reports and reproducible research](http://rstudio.com/training/curriculum/reports-and-reproducible-research.html) in [San Francisco](http://rstudio-sf.eventbrite.com/), Dec 3-4.

  * [Advanced R programming](http://rstudio.com/training/curriculum/advanced-r-programming.html) and [package development](http://rstudio.com/training/curriculum/package-development.html) in [Washington DC](http://rstudio-dc.eventbrite.com/), Dec 10-12.

We've also planned a number of [other courses](http://rstudio.com/training/), based on our experience with the R community, seeing what's hard to learn and what people are struggling with. These courses are available now if you'd like us to come to [your company](http://rstudio.com/training/on-site.html), and based on [your feedback](http://rstudio.com/training/public-courses.html) we'll offer public versions in the near future.

You can also read about [our instructors](http://rstudio.com/training/trainers.html) and [our philosophy](http://rstudio.com/training/philosophy.html).
