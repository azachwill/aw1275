Please join us for our popular Introduction to R course for data scientists and data analysts in San Francisco on April 28 and 29.  This is a two-day workshop, designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to R that will have you analyzing and modeling data with R in no time. We will cover practical skills for visualizing, transforming, and modeling data in R. You will learn how to explore and understand data as well as how to build linear and non-linear models in R.

The course will be led by RStudio Master Instructor and author Dr. Garrett Grolemund.
