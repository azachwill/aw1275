Version 0.3.0 of Shiny is now available on CRAN. This version of Shiny has several new features and bug fixes. Some of the changes are under the hood: for example, Shiny now uses a more efficient algorithm for scheduling the execution of reactive functions. There are also some user-facing changes: for example, the new `runGitHub()` function lets you download and run applications directly from a GitHub repository.

We've updated the [tutorial page](http://rstudio.github.com/shiny/tutorial/) with documentation about these and other features. For a full list of changes, see the the [NEWS file](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shiny/NEWS).

You can install the new version of Shiny with `install.packages('shiny')`.
