RStudio Beta 3 (v0.94) is [available for download](http://www.rstudio.org/download/) today. The goal for this release was to refine and improve our core features based on the feedback we've gotten on our first two betas. Highlights of the new release include:

  * **Source editor enhancements** — New editor features include brace/paren/quote matching, more intelligent cursor placement after newlines, function navigation, regex find and replace, run to/from the current line, and a command to re-run the last code region. There's naturally still lots more we'd like to do in the editor and we plan to keep improving it with each beta release.

  * **New plot export** **features** — We now have a much more flexible plot export UI that supports several formats including PDF, JPEG, TIFF, SVG, BMP, Metafile, and Postscript. The new UI also includes resizable image preview with the ability to maintain the current aspect ratio.

  * **Package installation and management**— We've added many more options to the install packages dialog including support for local archives and multiple target libraries. There is also a new check for package updates dialog as well as the ability to filter the packages listing by name and/or description.

  * **Dozens of other small improvements** — We've also made many smaller enhancements including context-aware F1 for help, sorting of file listings, resizable plot zoom window, custom PDF export sizes, removing items from history, additional working directory commands, optional syntax highlighting for console input, and .zip and .tar.gz packages for users installing without admin privilleges.

Full details on the various new features, enhancements, and bug fixes in v0.94 are in the [release notes](http://www.rstudio.org/docs/release_notes_v0.94).

Thanks again to everyone for the thorough and thoughtful feedback on our previous betas, please keep it coming!
