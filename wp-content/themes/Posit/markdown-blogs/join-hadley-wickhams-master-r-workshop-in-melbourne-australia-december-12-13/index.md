It's nearly summeRtime in Australia! Join RStudio Chief Data Scientist Hadley Wickham for his popular Master R workshop in Melbourne.

Register here:  <https://www.eventbrite.com/e/master-r-developer-workshop-melbourne-tickets-22546200292>

Melbourne will be Hadley's first and only scheduled Master R workshop in Australia. Whether you live or work nearby or you just need one more good reason to visit Melbourne in the Southern Hemisphere spring, consider joining him at the Cliftons Melbourne on December 12th and 13th. It's a rare opportunity to learn from one of the R community's most popular and innovative authors and package developers.

Hadley's workshops usually sell out. This is his final Master R in 2016 and he has no plans to offer another in the area in 2017. If you're an active R user and have been meaning to take this class, now is the perfect time to do it!

We look forward to seeing you in Melbourne!
