As part our series on new features in the [RStudio v1.2 Preview Release](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/), we're pleased to announce the [r2d3 package](https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/), a suite of tools for using custom [D3 visualizations](https://d3js.org/) with R.

RStudio v1.2 includes several features to help optimize your development experience with **r2d3**. We'll describe these features below, but first a bit more about the package. Features of **r2d3** include:

  - Translating R objects into D3 friendly data structures

  - Publishing D3 visualizations to the web

  - Incorporating D3 scripts into [R
    Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) reports, presentations,
    and dashboards

  - Creating interacive D3 applications with
    [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)

  - Distributing D3 based [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org) in R
    packages

<div style="clear: both">

With **r2d3**, you can bind data from R to D3 visualizations like the
ones found on <https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery>,
<https://bl.ocks.org/>, and
<https://vida.io/explore>:

<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

<a href="https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/articles/gallery/chord/"><img src="chord_thumbnail.png" width="28%" class="illustration gallery-thumbnail"/></a>  <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/articles/gallery/bubbles/"><img src="bubbles_thumbnail.png" width="28%" class="illustration gallery-thumbnail"/></a>  <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/articles/gallery/cartogram/"><img src="cartogram_thumbnail.png" width="28%" class="illustration gallery-thumbnail"/></a>

</div>

D3 visualizations created with **r2d3** work just like R plots within
RStudio, R Markdown documents, and Shiny applications.

You can install the **r2d3** package from CRAN as follows:

```{{r}}
install.packages("r2d3")
```


## D3 Scripts

To use **r2d3**, write a D3 script and then pass R data to it using the
`r2d3()` function. For example, here’s a simple D3 script that draws a
bar chart (“barchart.js”):

``` js
// !preview r2d3 data=c(0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 0.95, 0.40, 0.20)

var barHeight = Math.floor(height / data.length);

svg.selectAll('rect')
  .data(data)
  .enter().append('rect')
    .attr('width', function(d) { return d * width; })
    .attr('height', barHeight)
    .attr('y', function(d, i) { return i * barHeight; })
    .attr('fill', 'steelblue');
```

To render the script within R you call the `r2d3()` function:

```
library(r2d3)
r2d3(data=c(0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 0.95, 0.40, 0.20), script = "barchart.js")
```

Which results in the following visualization:

<img src="bar_chart.png" class="illustration" width=600/>

### D3 Variables

Note that data is provided to the script using the `data` argument to
the `r2d3()` function. This data is then automatically made available to
the D3 script. There are a number of other special variables available
within D3 scripts, including:

  - `data` — The R data converted to JavaScript.
  - `svg` — The svg container for the visualization
  - `width` — The current width of the container
  - `height` — The current height of the container
  - `options` — Additional options provided by the user
  - `theme` — Colors for the current theme

When you are learning D3 or translating D3 examples for use with R it’s
important to keep in mind that D3 examples will generally include code
to load data, create an SVG or other root element, and establish a width
and height for the visualization.

On the other hand with **r2d3**, these variables are *provided
automatically* so do not need to be created. The reasons these variables
are provided automatically are:

1)  So that you can dynamically bind data from R to visualizations; and

2)  So that **r2d3** can automatically handle dynamic resizing for your
    visualization. Most D3 examples have a static size. This is fine for
    an example but not very robust for including the visualization
    within a report, dashboard, or application.

## RStudio v1.2 and r2d3

The [RStudio v1.2 preview
release](https://www.rstudio.com/rstudio/download/preview/)
includes support for previewing D3 scripts as you write them. To try this out, install the preview release
then create a D3 script using the new file menu:

<img src="new_script.png" class="screenshot" width=600/>

A simple template for a D3 script (the barchart.js example shown above)
is provided by default. You can use the **Preview** command
(Ctrl+Shift+Center) to render the
visualization:

<img src="rstudio_preview.png" class="screenshot" width=600/>

You might wonder where the data comes from for the preview. Note that
there is a special comment at the top of the D3 script:

``` js
// !preview r2d3 data=c(0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 0.95, 0.40, 0.20)
```

This comment enables you to specify the data (along with any other
arguments to the `r2d3()` function) to use for the preview.

## R Markdown

RStudio v1.2 also includes support for rendering **r2d3** visualizations within R Markdown documents and R Notebooks. There is a new `d3` R Markdown engine which works like this:

<pre><code>&#96``{r setup}
library(r2d3)
bars &lt;- c(10, 20, 30)
&#96``

&#96``{d3 data=bars, options=list(color = 'orange')}
svg.selectAll('rect')
  .data(data)
  .enter()
    .append('rect')
      .attr('width', function(d) { return d * 10; })
      .attr('height', '20px')
      .attr('y', function(d, i) { return i * 22; })
      .attr('fill', options.color);
&#96``</code></pre>

<img src="rmarkdown-1.png" class="illustration" width=600/>

Note that in order to use the `d3` engine you need to add
`library(r2d3)` to the setup chunk (as illustrated above).

You can also of course call the `r2d3()` function from within
an R code chunk:

<pre><code>---
output: html_document
---

&#96``{r}
library(r2d3)
r2d3(data=c(0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 0.95, 0.40, 0.20), script = "barchart.js")
&#96``</code></pre>

<img src="bar_chart.png" class="illustration" width=600/>

## Shiny

The `renderD3()` and `d3Output()` functions enable you to include D3
visualizations within Shiny applications:

```
library(shiny)
library(r2d3)

ui <- fluidPage(
  inputPanel(
    sliderInput("bar_max", label = "Max:",
                min = 0.1, max = 1.0, value = 0.2, step = 0.1)
  ),
  d3Output("d3")
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  output$d3 <- renderD3({
    r2d3(
      runif(5, 0, input$bar_max),
      script = system.file("examples/baranims.js", package = "r2d3")
    )
  })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

<img src="baranim-1.gif" class="illustration" width=600/>

See the article on [Using r2d3 with
Shiny](https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/articles/shiny.html) to learn more
(including how to create custom Shiny inputs that respond to user
interaction with D3 visualizations).
