It all started with a call booked on the RStudio website.

> My name is Óli Páll, and I am the Chief Data Officer at the City of Reykjavík in Iceland. My team and I have been tasked with the development of a data warehouse from scratch - and serving a data science team in the city…

Óli had to provide value — and quickly. His team needed to feel empowered to experiment and learn. His stakeholders wanted to see tangible outputs from their discussions. The higher-ups had to trust in the data science team's work.

Open source made it possible. The team could meet with a department head on Monday and show them an interactive prototype on Wednesday, all thanks to their skills with R. Óli wanted to know, what *else* was possible? What could they accomplish with a full suite of open-source tools?

In the end, Óli's team transformed the digital landscape for the residents of Reykjavik. A group from RStudio flew to Iceland to capture their story.
