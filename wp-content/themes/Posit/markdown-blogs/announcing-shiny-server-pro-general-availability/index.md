  * Secure access to Shiny applications with authentication systems such as LDAP and Active Directory

  * Configure a Shiny application to use more than one process

  * Control the number of concurrent users per application

  * Gain insight into your applications' CPU and memory use

  * Get help directly from our team at RStudio
