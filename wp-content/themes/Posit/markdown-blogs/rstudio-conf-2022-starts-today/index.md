If you are wondering how to fit everything you want to do in these four days, Tracy Teal, RStudio's Open Source Program Director, recommends coming to conf with one or two goals in mind. Is it someone you want to meet, something you want to learn, a talk you want to see? Then organize your activities accordingly so that you can make them happen! And of course, please reach out to RStudio staff if we can help you achieve your goals.

We can’t wait to see you at rstudio::conf(2022)!
