We are excited to announce that submissions for lightning talks at rstudio::conf are now open! Lightning talks are short (5 minute) high energy presentations that give you the chance to talk about an interesting project that you've tackled with R. Short talks, or demos of your R code, R packages, and shiny apps are great options. See some of the great lightning talks from the [Shiny Developer Conference](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/shiny-developer-conference/) (scroll down to user talks).

[Submit your lightning talk proposal here!](https://rstudio.typeform.com/to/npmvlz)

**Submissions are due December 1, 2016.** We'll announce the accepted talks on December 15. (You must be a registered attendee of rstudio::conf to present a lightning talk.)
