rstudio::conf(2022), our main event for all things R and RStudio, ended in July. The workshop instructors, teaching assistants, speakers, and folks behind the scenes did a fantastic job delivering hours of incredible content over four days.

The conference may be over, but all the talks and keynotes are now available on YouTube. We hope you catch up on a talk you may have missed, rewatch a keynote or two, or take the opportunity to learn about a new package.

Below, we pulled a random sample of sessions to start you off using some favorite R functions: `set.seed()` and `dplyr::slice_sample()`. <a href="https://gist.github.com/ivelasq/9d977224cc0dc2c7a72a445e98e23eea" target = "_blank">See the code here!</a>
