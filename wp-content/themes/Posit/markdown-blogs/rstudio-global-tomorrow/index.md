The day you've all been waiting for is almost here: rstudio::global(2021) starts tomorrow! This 24-hour virtual event will focus on all things R and RStudio, featuring 50+ speakers from around the world, and it begins at 1600GMT (11 am EST, 8 am PST) on January 21, 2021.

If you want to attend rstudio::global, you don't need a gold-embossed invitation, but you do still need to register, which you can do at <a href="/conference">rstudio.com/conference</a>. You'll be joining more than 12,000 attendees from 136 countries who are already registered and planning to attend.

But once you are registered, you are not done! After you've registered, you should <a href="https://global.rstudio.com/student/all_events" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plan your conference and enroll for the sessions you want to attend</a>. Every talk will be given twice, so choose the talks that are most convenient for your local time. You'll have three tracks of talks and more than 50 sessions to choose from, so planning in advance will ensure you don't miss any of your favorite speakers. Should you need help converting the times shown into your local time, I recommend using the <a  href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20210121T160000&p1=136&p2=43" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time zone converter at timeanddate.com</a>. And just as like at rstudio::conf events in years past, stay tuned for social opportunities that will be announced once rstudio::global begins.

So don't wait; start compiling your conference schedule now. The 24 hours of rstudio::global(2021) are less than a day away!
