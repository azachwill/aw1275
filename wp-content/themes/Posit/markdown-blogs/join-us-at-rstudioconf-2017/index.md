Following our initial and very gratifying Shiny Developer Conference this past January, which sold out in a few days, RStudio is very excited to announce a new and bigger conference today!

[**rstudio::conf**](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/), the conference about all things R and RStudio, will take place January 13 and 14, 2017 in Orlando, Florida. The conference will feature talks and tutorials from popular RStudio data scientists and developers like Hadley Wickham, Yihui Xie, Joe Cheng, Winston Chang, Garrett Grolemund, and J.J. Allaire, along with lightning talks from RStudio partners and customers.

Preceding the conference, on January 11 and 12, RStudio will offer two days of optional training. Training attendees can choose from Hadley Wickham's Master R training, a new Intermediate Shiny workshop from Shiny creator Joe Cheng or a new workshop from Garrett Grolemund that is based on his soon-to-be-published book with Hadley: Introduction to Data Science with R.

[**rstudio::conf**](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) is for R and RStudio users who want to learn how to write better shiny applications in a better way, explore all the new capabilities of the R Markdown authoring framework, apply R to big data and work effectively with Spark, understand the RStudio toolchain for data science with R, discover best practices and tips for coding with RStudio, and investigate enterprise scale development and deployment practices and tools, including the new RStudio Connect.

_Not to be missed, RStudio has also reserved Universal Studio's The Wizarding World of Harry Potter on Friday night, January 13, for the exclusive use of conference attendees!_

Conference attendance is limited to 400. Training is limited to 70 students for each of the three 2-day workshops. All seats are are available on a first-come, first-serve basis.
