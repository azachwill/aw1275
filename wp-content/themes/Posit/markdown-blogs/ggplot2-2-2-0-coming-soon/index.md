I'm planning to release ggplot2 2.2.0 in early November. In preparation, I'd like to announce that a release candidate is now available: version 2.1.0.9001. Please try it out, and file an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2/issues) if you discover any problems. I hope we can find and fix any major issues before the official release.

Install the pre-release version with:

```{{r}}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hadley/ggplot2")
```

If you discover a major bug that breaks your plots, please [file a minimal reprex](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2/issues), and then roll back to the released version with:

```{{r}}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

ggplot2 2.2.0 will be a relatively major release including:

  * Subtitles and captions.

  * A large rewrite of the facetting system.

  * Improved theme options.

  * Better stacking

  * [Numerous bug fixes and minor improvements](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2/blob/master/NEWS.md).

The majority of this work was carried out by [Thomas Pedersen](https://github.com/thomasp85), who I was lucky to have as my "ggplot2 intern" this summer. Make sure to check out other visualisation packages: [ggraph](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph), [ggforce](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggforce), and [tweenr](https://github.com/thomasp85/tweenr).

## Subtitles and captions

Thanks to [Bob Rudis](https://rud.is/), you can now add subtitles and captions:

```{{r}}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "loess") +
  labs(
    title = "Fuel efficiency generally decreases with engine size",
    subtitle = "Two seaters (sports cars) are an exception because of their light weight",
    caption = "Data from fueleconomy.gov"
  )
```

![unnamed-chunk-3-1](https://rstudioblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

These are controlled by the theme settings `plot.subtitle` and `plot.caption`.

The plot title is now aligned to the left by default. To return to the previous centering, use `theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))`.

## Facets

The facet and layout implementation has been moved to ggproto and received a large rewrite and refactoring. This will allow others to create their own facetting systems, as descrbied in the _Extending ggplot2_ vignette. Along with the rewrite a number of features and improvements has been added, most notably:

  * Functions in facetting formulas, thanks to [Dan Ruderman](https://github.com/DanRuderman).

```{{r}}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_hex(bins = 20) +
  facet_wrap(~cut_number(depth, 6))
```

![unnamed-chunk-4-1](https://rstudioblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

  * Axes were dropped when the panels in `facet_wrap()` did not completely fill the rectangle. Now, an axis is drawn underneath the hanging panels:

```{{r}}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~class)
```

![unnamed-chunk-5-1](https://rstudioblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

  * It is now possible to set the position of the axes through the `position` argument in the scale constructor:

```{{r}}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(position = "top") +
  scale_y_continuous(position = "right")
```

![unnamed-chunk-6-1](https://rstudioblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

  * You can display a secondary axis that is a one-to-one transformation of the primary axis with the `sec.axis` argument:

```{{r}}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(
    "mpg (US)",
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . * 1.20, name = "mpg (UK)")
  )
```

![unnamed-chunk-7-1](https://rstudioblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

  * Strips can be placed on any side, and the placement with respect to axes can be controlled with the `strip.placement` theme option.

```{{r}}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ drv, strip.position = "bottom") +
  theme(
    strip.placement = "outside",
    strip.background = element_blank(),
    strip.text = element_text(face = "bold")
  ) +
  xlab(NULL)
```

![unnamed-chunk-8-1](https://rstudioblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

## Theming

  * Blank elements can now be overridden again so you get the expected behavior when setting e.g. `axis.line.x`.

  * `element_line()` gets an `arrow` argument that lets you put arrows on axes.

```{{r}}
arrow <- arrow(length = unit(0.4, "cm"), type = "closed")

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.line = element_line(arrow = arrow)
  )
```

![unnamed-chunk-9-1](https://rstudioblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

  * Control of legend styling has been improved. The whole legend area can be aligned according to the plot area and a box can be drawn around all legends:

```{{r}}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, shape = drv, colour = fl)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(
    legend.justification = "top",
    legend.box.margin = margin(3, 3, 3, 3, "mm"),
    legend.box.background = element_rect(colour = "grey50")
  )
```

![unnamed-chunk-10-1](https://rstudioblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

  * `panel.margin` and `legend.margin` have been renamed to `panel.spacing` and `legend.spacing` respectively as this better indicates their roles. A new `legend.margin` has been actually controls the margin around each legend.

  * When computing the height of titles ggplot2, now inclues the height of the descenders (i.e. the bits `g` and `y` that hang underneath). This makes improves the margins around titles, particularly the y axis label. I have also very slightly increased the inner margins of axis titles, and removed the outer margins.

  * The default themes has been tweaked by [Jean-Olivier Irisson](http://www.obs-vlfr.fr/~irisson/) making them better match `theme_grey()`.

  * Lastly, the `theme()` function now has named arguments so autocomplete and documentation suggestions are vastly improved.

## Stacking bars

`position_stack()` and `position_fill()` now stack values in the reverse order of the grouping, which makes the default stack order match the legend.

```{{r}}
avg_price <- diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut, color) %>%
  summarise(price = mean(price)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(price_rel = price - mean(price))

ggplot(avg_price) +
  geom_col(aes(x = cut, y = price, fill = color))
```

![unnamed-chunk-11-1](https://rstudioblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

(Note also the new `geom_col()` which is short-hand for `geom_bar(stat = "identity")`, contributed by Bob Rudis.)

Additionally, you can now stack negative values:

```{{r}}
ggplot(avg_price) +
  geom_col(aes(x = cut, y = price_rel, fill = color))
```

![unnamed-chunk-12-1](https://rstudioblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)

The overall ordering cannot necessarily be matched in the presence of negative values, but the ordering on either side of the x-axis will match.

If you want to stack in the opposite order, try [`forcats::fct_rev()`](http://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_rev.html):

```{{r}}
ggplot(avg_price) +
  geom_col(aes(x = cut, y = price, fill = fct_rev(color)))
```
