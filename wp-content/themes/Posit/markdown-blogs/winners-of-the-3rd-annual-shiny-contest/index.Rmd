Once again the Shiny community has wowed us with their contributions to the 3rd annual Shiny Contest that we <a href = "https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/03/11/time-to-shiny/">announced back in March 2021</a>.

We had 179 submissions from 164 unique Shiny developers to the contest this year over the two-month period submission period for the contest, with over 40% of participants indicating that they have less than one year experience with Shiny!

# Evaluation and judging

Apps were evaluated based on technical merit and artistic achievement.
Some apps excelled in one of these categories and some in the other, and some in both.
Evaluation also took into account the narrative on the contest submission post on RStudio Community.

Before we go on to announcing the winners, we would like to thank our esteemed judges who helped us evaluate the submissions.

# Grand prizes

## Less than one year experience

### üèÜ <a href = "https://connect.thinkr.fr/wedding" target = "_blank">{wedding}: a Shiny app to help future grooms</a>

by <a href = 'https://community.rstudio.com/u/MargotBrd' target = '_blank'>Margot Brard</a>

<img src="images/wedding.gif" align="center" width="80%" alt="GIF of the wedding app that browses the wedding app and shows various screens of the app and the functionality like adding guests.">

Guests can get logistical information about the wedding, confirm their attendance, and indicate their menu choice.
The future bride and groom have access the wedding dashboard (visualization of expenses, number of confirmations, seating charts, ...).
Read more about the app <a href = 'https://community.rstudio.com/t/wedding-a-shiny-app-to-help-future-grooms-shiny-contest-submission/104657' target = '_blank'>here</a>.

The judges loved this novel approach to a very real problem (terrible wedding websites!) and especially enjoyed the table setting plans in the bride and groom only area.

### üèÜ <a href = "https://sharukkhanstat777.shinyapps.io/MathEagleGame/" target = "_blank">Math Eagle Game</a>

by <a href = 'https://community.rstudio.com/u/Sharukkhan' target = '_blank'>Sharukkhan</a>

<img src="images/math-eagle.png" align="center" width="80%" alt="Screenshot of the Math Eagle Game. Sidebar shows the answer status and the main panel shows the game where the eagle flies across the screen and the user needs to guess the right answer to the math question for the eagle to keep flying.">

When the user clicks on START, the page directs to a mathematical game.
The objective of the game is to make the math eagle reach outer space.
For each correct or incorrect answer, the user is notified and the speed changes accordingly.
After completing 2 minutes, the page directs to Scoreboard, where the player can view the scores as well as highlights.
Read more about the app <a href = 'https://community.rstudio.com/t/math-eagle-game-shiny-contest-submission/104836' target = '_blank'>here</a>.

The judges thought this was a very fun take on a math game for kids.
They loved the technical implementation of this application with proper use of functions to reduce the codebase, and very proper use of reactivity and remarked that this was particularly impressive for someone relatively new to Shiny!

### üèÜ <a href = "https://neoxone.shinyapps.io/BCGOV_CCISS" target = "_blank">Shiny app for climate change informed tree species selection</a>

by <a href = 'https://community.rstudio.com/u/meztez' target = '_blank'>Bruno Tremblay</a>

Read more about the app <a href = 'https://community.rstudio.com/t/shiny-app-for-climate-change-informed-tree-species-selection-shiny-contest-submission/99916' target = '_blank'>here</a>.

The judges thought the app showed high technical rigor, and especially highlighted that it's structured as a package.
Not only is the reactive functionality in the app is smooth, it's also robust to errors with gentle fail mechanisms vs. crashing the app!

## More than one year experience

### üèÜ <a href = "https://jpd527.shinyapps.io/racetrack/" target = "_blank">Racetrack 2: Electric Boogaloo</a>

by <a href = 'https://community.rstudio.com/u/jdeweese' target = '_blank'>Jackson DeWeese</a> and <a href = 'https://community.rstudio.com/u/dfrye' target = '_blank'>Darren Frye</a>

<img src="images/racetrack2.png" align="center" width="80%" alt="Screenshot of the Racetrack 2 app, showing the game controls on the sidebar and the race track in the main panel.">

A digital version of the paper & pencil game Racetrack taken from its start on graph paper in the ‚Äò60s to an online click-to-drive game, Racetrack 2: Electric Boogaloo uses Shiny‚Äôs reactivity with global variables to create a multiplayer experience.

### üèÜ <a href = "https://nz-stefan.shinyapps.io/commute-explorer-2/" target = "_blank">Commute Explorer</a>

by <a href = 'https://community.rstudio.com/u/nz-stefan' target = '_blank'>Stefan Schliebs</a>

<img src="images/commute-explorer.gif" align="center" width="80%" alt="GIF showing the functionality of the Commute Explorer app.">

This project explores the commuting behavior of New Zealanders based on the Stats NZ Census 2018 data set.

Read more about the app <a href = 'https://community.rstudio.com/t/commute-explorer-shiny-contest-submission/104651' target = '_blank'>here</a>.

The judges remaked that "this app is GORGEOUS"! Via the use of an HTML template, the app looks nothing like a standard Shiny app. Plug and play: it's very simple to understand what it does!

### üèÜ <a href = "https://mdubel.shinyapps.io/shark-attack/" target = "_blank">Shark Attack</a>

by <a href = 'https://community.rstudio.com/u/mdubel' target = '_blank'>Marcin Dubel</a>

<img src="images/shark-attack.gif" align="center" width="80%" alt="GIF of the Shark Attack app showing the diver swimming through the screen to collect trash.">

### üèÜ <a href = "https://jpd527.shinyapps.io/racetrack/" target = "_blank">dinnR</a>

by <a href = 'https://community.rstudio.com/u/koderkow' target = '_blank'>Kyle Harris</a> and <a href = 'https://community.rstudio.com/u/actualtoilet' target = '_blank'>Alexis Meskowski</a>

<img src="images/dinnr.png" align="center" width="80%" alt="Screenshot of the dinnR app showing meal and grocery store shopping list planning for a week of dinners.">

The dinnR app is a weekly meal planning app for dinner. Simply pick your meals from a community-driven database of recipes, and dinnR will generate a list of items needed for the week. Remove ingredients you have at home and the remaining ingredients can be used as a shopping list. Links are provided to each recipe along with credit to the user that submitted them. The options tab allows you to change the planning dates, set a measurement system, and filter by dietary restrictions. The "Submit a Recipe" tab lets the user submit recipes they enjoy to the app where we credit them. Read more about the app <a href = 'https://community.rstudio.com/t/dinnr-shiny-contest-submission/104773' target = '_blank'>here</a>.

The judges thought the idea of the app is really fun and were impressed by the participation from the twitch audience filling in the data -- the developers stream on <a href = "https://www.twitch.tv/theeatgamelove" target = "_blanl">twitch.tv</a>, and among other things, they stream coding sessions on Saturday mornings! The judges also commented that the code is super clean and very impressive (with the use of Shiny modules and organization as an R package).

### üèÜ <a href = "https://jksserver.shinyapps.io/shiny_markdown_organiser/" target = "_blank">A minimalist Markdown organiser</a>

by <a href = 'https://community.rstudio.com/u/jacksonkwok' target = '_blank'>Chun Fung Kwok</a>

Type Markdown in the textbox on the left, see rendered organiser on the right. "Click" an item/card on the board to edit the text, and "Drag" to move the items/cards around to desired location. Updates are bidirectional.
