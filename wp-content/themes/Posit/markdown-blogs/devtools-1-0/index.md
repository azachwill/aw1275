We're very pleased to announce the release of devtools 1.0.  We've given devtools the 1.0 marker because it now works with the vast majority of packages in the wild, with this version adding support for S4 and Rcpp.  Devtools also has completely revamped code for finding Rtools on windows, including much better error messages if something is wrong with your setup. In celebration of reaching 1.0, devtools now has it's [own webpage](https://www.rstudio.com/projects/devtools/), which provides a bit more information about why you might want to use it.

Devtools 1.0 also contains many other bug fixes and minor improvements, as listed in the [NEWS](https://github.com/hadley/devtools/blob/master/NEWS) file on github.
