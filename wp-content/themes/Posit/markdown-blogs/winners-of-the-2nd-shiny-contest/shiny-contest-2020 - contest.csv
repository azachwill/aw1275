 An article by Julia Silge about Structural Topic Models gave the inspiration for this project. I have often struggled to extract meaningful information from free text documents but Julia's results looked very convincing. Additionally the chosen topic model algorithm can take advantage of additional meta information associated for each document. The blog article by Andrea De Angelis explained how to exploit publication dates of documents and show topic trends over time. After some digging I found the vignette of the stminsights package which provides functionality to extract topic correlation graphs from the trained structural topic model. All these resources put enough ideas in my head to create this app.
 
 **Data**
 
 I am a fond reader of blog articles published on R-Bloggers. It is an aggregator for blogs about R and has been around for more than a decade. I thought it would be very interesting to see how the R scene has developed over the last 10 years. What topics were talked about in the past, what are people writing about today? Would we see the rise of Shiny, the tidyverse, Rmarkdown, CRAN releases, conference announcements?
 
 I scraped the blog data from R-Bloggers from their public archives using the super convenient rvest package. The process is split into three phases to allow me later to change my mind about the particular processing of articles.
 
 1. Obtain a list of links to articles published on R-Bloggers
 2. Download each article from the link collection
 3. Parse each document and combined them into a single dataframe
 
 For each document I also collected meta information such as blog title, publication date, author and URLs to the original blog. In total I collected more than 30,000 articles published as early as Jan 2010.
 
 For the ongoing data refresh I download the R-Blogger RSS feeds every day using a script running in a Docker container on AWS on a daily schedule. The RSS feed is a XML file that contains the latest 25 articles published on the website. At the end of each month a second script in a second container combines the articles in all collected feeds with the 30,000 scraped articles and refreshes the topic model behind this application. So every month something new should appear in this Shiny app.
 
 **Topic Model**
 
 I followed Julia Silge's methodology to determine the optimal number of topics. The process involves training several models with varying number of topics and then inferring a reasonable topic number from a variety of diagnostic plots. The training took many hours to complete, I let the machine run over night despite parallelising the computation.
 
 The topic models are generated using the stm package. Papers on the topic algorithm can be found here. Some code from the tidystm package was used to transform STM outputs into tidy format.
 
 Did it work?
 
 So did it actually work? Did the topic model identify relevant R trends? I think it did! Here are the results for three particular topics. The top row of bar charts shows the overall prevalence of the shown topics. The middle row shows the estimated topic proportion across the corpus over time and the bottom row of word clouds presents the top terms in each of the topics. We see the increased interest in machine learning and deep neural networks, the rise of the tidyverse (lots of dplyr verbs) and the popularity of Shiny. Click on the image to enlarge.

 The topic correlation graph reveals an interesting cluster of correlated topics about specific machine learning aspects. There are two separate ""modelling"" topics, one about statistical models (linear/logistic regression, GLM, GAM, ANOVA) and the other about machine learning algorithms (decision trees, random forest, GBM, xgboost, train/test, validation). Related topics are about Bayesian inference (STAN, prior and posterior, MCMC), model scoring (measures, results, rules), cluster analysis (hierarchical clustering, PCA, dimensionality reduction), exploratory analysis (densities, distributions, outliers, medians and means), deep learning (neural networks, keras, tensorflow) and hypothesis testing (although this topic also contains several cricket terms which could indicate the content is about a different kind of test). Pretty good for an unsupervised algorithm!
 
 image
 
 Other big topics cover various types of visualisations (ggplot, maps), networks, time series forecasting, text mining, books and chapters, parallel processing, learning about Python, projects and tools and software, github, file formats, conference talks and presentations, APIs and Rmarkdown. There is even a topic about the US presidential election with spiking coverage in 2016 and 2012 (when the elections occurred).
 
 Overall, I am very happy with these results. In fact, I think they are quite astonishing. Without any additional information about this corpus, the topic model has identified a lot of meaningful topics and most topics are immediately recognizable as relevant R related content.
 
 
 **Application**
 
 I like beautiful data products and so I used HTML templates to create a unique look for this Shiny application. The template is called Titan and is freely available. There was a bit more JavaScript foo necessary for the network visualisation.
 
 To improve readability, the code is structured using Shiny modules.
 
 
 **Deployment**
 
 The development environment of this project is a Rocker based Docker container running the Open Source version of RStudio Server. Docker allows to control all aspects of the development environment, i.e. operating system, system packages and R version. The versions of R packages are tracked using the renv package. The containerisation intends to simplify the setup of a working development environment.",2020-03-30T09:15:41Z,"Beautiful UI and interesting application, especially the topic modeling on blogs.

 This project is re-work of [gitdiscoverer.com](https://rajkstats.shinyapps.io/rstudio-shiny-contest/) which is the first shiny web app I built as part of Rstudio Shiny Contest 2019. Idea of re-building this to try out skills I learned over past year. I have improved my front-end skills which I'm putting in to use here and added few features which might be useful for end users.
 
 ### What's new?
 
 - Browse Popular Machine Learning and Deep Learning (ML/DL) Projects on Github
 - Topic Tags (Available in Trending Repositories, Popular Projects tabs)
 - Dynamically Rendering Info in Bootstrap cards component
 - Sort By Trend, Stars, and Forks
 - Disconnect screen for Shiny Server
 
 ### Architecture 
 
 <p align=""left"">
  <img width=""460"" height=""300"" src=""www/GitDiscoverer.jpg"">
 </p>
 
 
 ### REST APIs 
 
 * [Github Official Developer API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) 
 * [Github Unofficial Trending API](https://github.com/huchenme/github-trending-api) 
  * [Trending Repositories](https://github-trending-api.now.sh/repositories?language=R&since=weekly) 
  * [Trending Developers](https://github-trending-api.now.sh/developers?language=R&since=weekly)
 
 ### Instructions 
 
 In order to run this app, Github provides REST API access to get variety of the data of your projects at Github. Since we are only interested in publicly available data. We will Authenticate with OAuth 2.0 which is the most secure option. 
 
 In order to use OAuth option, you need **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. If you don‚Äôt have them yet, go to 
 
 1. [Github Developers settings page](https://github.com/settings/developers) , then **Oauth Applications** 
 2. **Register a new Application** say
 
  > Application Name: **Rstudio Shiny Contest 2020** 
  > Homepage URL : http://github.com 
  > Application description : Rstudio Shiny Contest 2020 
  > Authorization callback URL : http://localhost:1410 
 
 On this page, you should be able to see Client key and Client Secret. Once you have the keys put them in **global.R** of this Shiny App and make sure you have active internet connection and you're all set to run **GitDiscoverer**.
 
 >> [More Detailed Explanation to Generate Keys at this Link](https://blog.exploratory.io/extract-data-from-private-github-repository-with-rest-api-db804fa43d84)
 
 
 #### **Reproducibility at RstudioCloud Server**
 
 In order to reproduce this app at rstudio cloud server, you will need to generate oauth tokens. In my case, I was getting an error which says bad credentials and error in callback url
 was error in uri redirect mismatch. Please follow the instructions at [rstudio support link](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/217952868-Generating-OAuth-tokens-from-a-server) 
 
 There are few steps to try on the ticket, but the one which worked for me on rstudio cloud server:
 
 > Create the .httr-oauth token on your desktop and then copy the file to a server

 # Starting a game
 From the start game screen you will be able to start a new in any difficulty (Easy, medium or hard).
 
 You can also toggle the tutorial on and of if you already know the basics of the game.
 
 ---
 
 # During the game
 The game UI has 3 main areas:
 
 #### Metrics
 Displays the current value of the different metrics you need to manage. Those metrics include:
 - **Karma:** Being too bad or too good wont lose you the game, but might have some hidden effects...
 - **Wealth:** Things cost money. No money no fun :/
 - **Public opinion:** If no one likes you, you probably wont last long in power!
 - **Environment:** If the world is beyond saving, whats the point?
 
 #### Map
 A visual representation of what effects your actions are having in the world. Icons and the map color with change depending on how high or low some metrics are.
 
 #### current task
 Your next task and the way you can move forward in the game. Above the task you can also see the current week in game. Every task you complete will move the game forward 1 week.
 
 Card colors reflect the card pool and severity of the current card. The darker the card the more severe the task is, and more change it will have on the metrics. Currently 3 cards pools are implemented:
 
 Bad cards (Cards that will have mostly negative consequences, red background)
 
 Good cards (Cards that will have mostly good consequences, green background)
 
 Special cards (Cards that will have unique consequences, purple background)
 
 If you want to know more about all the possible cards and options available, you can check the google spreadsheet containing all possibilities at: 
 `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LwIPKAxbKvuGyMKktcTVuYZbTda0WMQxmNMhxqaQhGg`
 
 #### Card stack
 Each task as 2 possible decisions, left or right. Simply drag and hold the card to each side to see what decisions you can take. while holding the card the names of the metrics that will be affected by that decision will also blink. Drag and release to commit to your decision.
 
 #### Game end
 when one of the metrics reaches zero, the game is over and you will be taken to the end game screen. Here you can see how many weeks you lasted, as well as return to the initial screen in case you want to go again.

 # Code Structure
 Shiny.decisions takes full advantage of modules and R6 classes for managing the code complexity.
 Most of the project is broken down into R6 managers that take care of specific parts of the workflow:
 
 ### Game Manager
 The brain being the game flow. It manages all game dependencies and is responsible for high level actions that drive the state of the game.
 
 ### Data Manager
 Connects and exposes all external data required by the app. This includes the main data storage regarding task cards, game options and game modes loaded from a google spreadsheet.
 
 Most options and cards can be added or tweaked without code changes directly on the spreadsheets.
 
 The current live spreadsheet can be found at:
 `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LwIPKAxbKvuGyMKktcTVuYZbTda0WMQxmNMhxqaQhGg`
 
 ### State Manager
 Stores information regarding the current state of the game. This includes the current value of the different metrics, map markers and state checks for specific game phases.
 
 ### Metrics Manager
 Responsible for displaying the current state metrics on the UI.
 
 ### Map Manager
 Responsible for displaying map information according to the the current state metrics on the UI.
 
 ### Deck Manager
 Responsible for creating cards according to the game state and switching between card pools depending on the current game phase.

The measures of comparison are given by valence, energy, tempo and loudness. This app is using the Spotify Web API via the spotifyr package.","Curious about the sentiment of your favorite artists? And how do they compare to other artists? Are specific artists changing their musical style over time? And do they vary more in their musical creativity than others? Answers to these type of questions can be found in this app. 
 
 The input of the app is given on the left-hand side. You can enter (part of) the name of the artist, click on the ‚ÄòSearch‚Äô button and select the artist you want to include. To actual-ly include the artist, click on the ‚ÄòAdd Artist‚Äô button, wait for a moment, and finally all in-formation will appear. You can click your added artists to get re-directed to their Wikipe-dia page. Click the trash icon to remove an artist, or the ‚ÄúClear all‚Äù button to remove all selected artists.
 
 There are five tabs that provide different information about your selected artists. The first tab provides a summary of the artists you‚Äôve selected. Here you get a quick overview of their reported genres, follower count, and popularity score. Furthermore, the median highest and lowest artists are shown for valence, energy, tempo and loudness.
 
 On the second tab you can find a plot of valence by energy. This plot was inspired by a contest submission of last year: <a href=""https://community.rstudio.com/t/shiny-contest-submission-sentify-spotify-musical-sentiment-visualization/25207"">Sentify</a>. Through the addition of centroids and plotting multiple artists, the plot has become a powerhouse of comparison.
 
 The third tab provides a timeline for the selected artists for valence, energy, tempo, and loudness. Here you can see how each artist may have changed their musical style over the years. The fourth tab provides density plots of valence, energy, tempo, and loud-ness to provide a detailed comparison between artists.
 
 The fifth and last tab provides a comparison of artists on variety of their music. We have defined variety as the number of musical keys (e.g. C Major, D Minor, etc) used on an album. Of course, albums that have more tracks have more opportunity of variety. To correct for this influence, we normalized the value by dividing the variety by the number of tracks on the record.",2020-04-03T09:34:32Z,"Slow load, but really cool/clean UI.

  - How is the German government performing?
  - How do other countries stop the disease from spreading?
  - How long does it take for the disease to spread?
  - For how long is there exponential growth?
  - How many people do actually die?
 To enable this I got pretty fast using shiny. With shiny you can select countries, date-ranges, make flexible tables with datatable. Great! Additionally, I used plotly to zoom into all plots, get better legends, make it easy to browse through my data.
 What else... shinymaterial makes the whole app look nice. It's a great package and comes with easy use on mobile devices. I guess that's it.
 Now I can answer all my questions by browsing through the app. It's easy to see how well South Korea managed Corona for example.

Data under-utilization, however remains a major challenge due to specific skill set required for data processing, interpretation, and analysis. To simplify end-user RNA-seq data interpretation, we created RNA-seq DRaMA (RNAseq Data Retrieval and Mining Analytical platform) - an R/Shiny interactive reporting system with user-friendly web interface for data exploration and visualization (https://hssgenomics.shinyapps.io/RNAseq_DRaMA/). The app supports many methods for data exploration including: sample PCA and multidimensional scaling, gene- and sample- correlation analyses, Venn diagram and UpSet set visualizations, gene expression group barplots and heatmaps with hierarchical clustering, volcano plots, pathway analysis with QuSAGE, and Transcription Factor network analysis. All plots are highly customized in terms of sample, feature, threshold, and color selections and create publication-ready pdf and tabular outputs. All features are well-documented with an in-app manual. RNAseq DRaMA has been extensively tested at the HSS Genomics Center with more than 100 projects delivered and several projects currently deployed in the public domain","![](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/rnaseqDrama_poster.png)
 
 In design of rnaseqDRaMA we were guided by several goal:
  ‚Ä¢ Compatibility with existing RNA-seq data processing pipelines
  ‚Ä¢ Interactivity via web-based interface
  ‚Ä¢ Consistent user interface
  ‚Ä¢ Customizable graphic and tabular outputs
  
 RNA-seq DRaMA does not allow the end user to perform initial differential expression analysis (DEA), but rather provides an interface to explore the analysis performed by a bioinformatician. Although implementing Shiny-based DEA is technically possible we decided not to provide this capability at a very early design stage.
 
 Three factors contributed to this decision: 
  ‚Ä¢ Computationally many aspects of creating the input for the platform are intractable for a typical user‚Äôs hardware (e.g.¬†pathway analysis). 
  ‚Ä¢ There is always a balance between accessibility and power, that is, a platform which could also perform DEA would inherently be more complex, and as a result, would be accessible to fewer users (especially to high-level decision-makers that have limited time to learn the technical nuances of DEA). From the very beginning we hoped to create a platform with a shallow learning curve. 
  ‚Ä¢ It is almost impossible to foresee specific experimental designs or the need for an unusual model to account for a variety of experimental and nuisance variables. Experimental requirements often necessitate creating complex contrasts that cannot be easily automated. As such a platform with DEA would lack generality and would require constant tweaking in response to new, unique experimental requirements.
 
 The RNA-seq DRaMA app relies on R *Shiny,* *shinydashboard*, *plotly* and *ggplot2* packages to implement the framework for interactive data visualization. Several additional packages were used to support specific tasks. All methods for RNA-seq data exploration and visualization are accessible from links on the sidebar. Each method is extensively parameterized to customize analyses and graphic outputs. Internal clipboard functionality allows genes selection from one analysis to be used as input for a different method. Limited wildcard support allows gene selection based on patterns (eg. IL* will select all genes that start with ‚ÄúIL‚Äù). Plots generated by the app can be saved in pdf or png formats. The app is extensively documented: brief description of each plot/method is provided in-app in the description boxes, more detailed description of functionality is available via [Manual](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/) at the sidebar. Currently, rnaseqDRaMA can be run as a local app in R environment or as a web application hosted on a shiny server or public services such as shinyapps.io. The app supports many methods for RNAseq data exploration, which we grouped into sections listed below: 
 
 [**Summary**](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/summary.html) - Provides a brief experiment summary including a link to sequencing quality control and statistics provided, effective number of reads for each sample, a table of samples and experimental variables, a gene-wise variance plot, and a P-value histogram.
 
 [**PCA**](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/pca.html) - Principal component analysis (PCA) and classic multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) of samples provides methods of reducing the number of variables describing your system to a few dimensions (called principal components, PC) that describe the largest sources of variation in your system. In RNA-seq, and other sequencing technologies, PCA is an efficient visualization tool for quickly identifying treatment effects on gene expression. It is also useful for diagnosing possible technical issues such as poor replicate reproducibility. PCA loadings heatmaps helps to determine principal component with largest contribution to a specific experimental variable 
 
 [**Correlation**](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/cor.html) - This section contains a sample correlation plot and gene coexpression heatmap to quickly identify outlying samples, visualize pairwise similarities between samples, and identify groups of genes whose expression changes in the same direction across all samples. R heatmaply package was used to create interactive heatmaps in rnaseqDRaMA.
 
 [**Set Intersections**](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/venn.html) - Venn Diagrams and their more exquisite counterpart, Upset Plots, provide an overview of overlaps between differentially expressed genes in different treatment/condition combinations. This section relies on several extensively modified functions from the VennDiagram package and UpSetR package
 
 [**Heatmap**](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/geneheat.html) - The Highly Variable Gene Heatmap is useful for identification of genes which are strongly altered across samples/conditions. In addition if a large enough number of samples are collected, heatmaps can inform the presence of outliers and genes which are most important for the observed effect of a treatment. The Custom Gene Selection Heatmap accepts gene names from a user and plots their expression changes across conditions (logCPMs) or comparisons (logFC). Combined with sets of genes from Set Intersections, custom heatmaps will give additional insight into how gene regulation is changing between conditions.
 
 [**Gene Expression**](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/geneexpr.html) - This section provides access to the table of raw and normalized read counts for each expressed gene identified in the experiment and creates customized bar graphs for user selected gene sets. 
 
 [**Differential Expression**](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/volcano.html) - Visualizes the results of differential expression analysis in the form of a volcano plot with several levels of gene selection. A Volcano Plot combines a measure of statistical significance (P-Value or FDR) with the magnitude of the change between compared samples. 
 
 [**Pathway Analysis**](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/qusage.html) - Visualizes the results of QuSAGE pathway analysis that reveals functionally-related sets of genes that are potentially co-regulated, and therefore may affect the outcome of an entire signaling or metabolic pathway. 
 
 [**TF Networks**](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/tfnetwork.html) - Transcription Factor Networks section identifies transcription factors in a supplied set of genes and links them to their targets within the same set of genes producing a network graph representation. If only a single transcription factor gene is selected, a network of nearest neighbors of that TF will be shown. These networks are built based on AnimalTFDB 3.0 and RegNetwork which includes both transcription factors and transcriptional co-factors.",2020-03-20T06:23:41Z,Hard to assess (it comes with a 14 chapter manual).

It contais maps and charts that allow users to visualize estimates of people‚Äôs access to employment, education and health services at a high spatial resolution and disaggregated by socioeconomic groups according to income level and color/race.","Dear all, We present you the Accessibility Atlas. This is a Shiny App that allows people to interactively explore the results of the [Access to Opportunities Project](https://www.ipea.gov.br/acessooportunidades/en/). The project is a research initiative led by the Institute for Applied Economic Research (Ipea - Brazil) with the aim to study transport accessibility and inequalities in access to opportunities in Brazilian cities. 
 
 Through the Accessibility Atlas app, users can navigate the results of the project with maps and charts to visualize estimates of people‚Äôs access to employment, education and health services at a high spatial resolution and disaggregated by socioeconomic groups according to income level and color/race. These estimates are presented separately by walking and cycling for the 20 largest cities in Brazil, and by public transport for 7 major cities. Accessibility levels are presented using two simple and intuitive metrics: the number of opportunities accessible under a given time threshold, and the travel time to the closest school or healthcare facility. The app is embedded in the [website of the Access to opportunities project](https://www.ipea.gov.br/acessooportunidades/en/sobre/), where one can find more information about the methods and the data used in the app.
 
 The app is divided in two panels: `Maps`, where users can visualize and explore the spatial distribution of access to opportunities in each city, and `Charts` that allow users to visualize and get a grasp of how large are inequalities in access to opportunities in Brazilian cities.
 
 
 On a more technical side, the Accessibility Atlas has at least three important features:
 
 * The app scales well with large spatial data sets. Accessibility estimates are presented in a high-resolution spatial grid of [Uber H3 hexagons](https://eng.uber.com/h3/) with a short diagonal of 357 meters. Large cities like S√£o Paulo or Rio de Janeiro have more than 10,000 spatial units, making traditional map exploration tools unsuitable. Our app uses the [mapdeck](https://symbolixau.github.io/mapdeck/articles/mapdeck.html) R package, which leverages on the deck.gl library, a really fast open source platform for large-scale WebGL data visualization. mapdeck makes editing attributes in the app and exploring the data easy like a walk in the park.
 
 * The **Accessibility Atlas** app has a friendly and yet comprehensive user interface (UI) that allows users to easily extract a lot of information from the data. In the map tab, for instance, the user can choose different options in five different attributes: city, accessibility indicator, transport mode, activity type and time threshold. The menu is also responsive in that these options automatically update when the user chooses a city for which there is no public transit data, for example. 
 
 * Finally, the app is bilingual. It is available in both Portuguese and English to reach Brazilians a wider global community; this includes bilingual content in all tabs, tiptools, modals, legends, titles, and exported graphs and data. The package shiny.i18n made this translation process much easier;",2020-03-20T17:39:17Z,portuguese

 Open Trade Statistics (OTS) was created with the intention to lower the barrier to working with international economic trade data. It includes a public API, a dashboard, and an R package for data retrieval.
 
 The project started when I was affected by the fact that many Latin American Universities have limited or no access to the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN COMTRADE).
 
 There are alternatives to COMTRADE, for example the Base Pour L‚ÄôAnalyse du Commerce International (BACI) constitutes an improvement over COMTRADE as it is constructed using the raw data and a method that reconciles the declarations of the exporter and the importer. The main problem with BACI is that you need UN COMTRADE institutional access to download their datasets.
 
 After contacting UN COMTRADE, and suggesting to them my idea of doing something similar to BACI but available for anyone and keeping commercial purposes out of the scope of the project, I got an authorization to share curated versions of their datasets.
 
 Different projects such as The Atlas of Economic complexity and The Obervatory of Economic complexity use UN COMTRADE data and focus on data visualization to answer questions like:
 
 * What did Germany export in 2016?
 * Who imported Electronics in 1980?
 * Who exported Refined Copper in 1990?
 * Where did Chile export Wine to in 2016?
 
 Unlike existing visualization projects, I wanted to focus on data retrieval and reproducibility, and the starting point was to study the existing trade data APIs to create something more flexible and easier to use than those tools.
 
 I started organizing code I wrote during the last four years at https://github.com/tradestatistics/. There was code there that I haven‚Äôt touched in more than two years, and I wrote almost no comments indicating what the parts of the code actually do, so it was not understandable for others.
 
 My data cleaning process was not reproducible, and it was tragic to discover! I decided to start using RStudio Server to test the code line by line, in a fresh environment, and then dividing the code into smaller pieces and commenting what the different sections actually do.
 
 Once I had reproducible results I took a snapshot of my packages by using packrat. To ensure reproducibility over time, I decided to build R from source, isolated from the system package manager and therefore avoiding accidental updates that might break the code.
 
 Is it worth mentioning that I‚Äôm using DigitalOcean virtual machines to store the datasets and run all the services required to run an API. Under their Open Source Sponsorships the server cost is subsidized. The base for the project is Ubuntu, the database of choice is PostgreSQL, and R constitutes 95% of the project.
 
 Thanks to Ma√´lle Salmon, Amanda Dobbyn, Jorge Cimentada, Emily Riederer, Mark Padgham the overall result can be said to be top quality!
 
 After a long reviewing process (more than six month considering initial submission!), what started as an individual process mutated into something that I consider a collective result. Thanks to the amazing team behind rOpenSci, to their constructive feedback, exhaustive software reviewing and the confidence to propose ideas that that I had never gotten, what you have now is not just a solid R package.
 
 The hours spent as a part of the reviewing process translated into changes to the database and the API. According to the reviewers comments, there are limited opportunities to implement server-side changes and then updating the R code. With the inclusion of different API parameters that I initially didn‚Äôt consider, the current API/package state provides an efficient solution way better than post-filtering. You‚Äôll always extract exactly the data you require and no more than that.

 This application was born upon discovering the existence of the Auckland Transport API, which provides transport feed information as per the Google Transit Feed Specification (GTFS). Static information and route geometries can be accessed via Auckland Transport open data platforms.
 
 The application is made up of a number of tools which provide a series of advantages over the existing available public transport tools:
 
 * Multiple Real Time Boards - the ability to view the due and delay of buses/trains at more than one stop, allowing users who can take multiple routes to complete their journey from A to B to see all the information consolidated in one place. Existing solutions only allow you to see the due time information of various services for one stop at once. Additionally, the user location can be provided; if this is provided, the walking time to stop is calculated and displayed so the user can determine if it is worthwhile heading to one stop over another, depending on when the bus is due and how long it would take them to arrive at the stop
 * Live Bus Locations - the live vehicle locations of all buses/trains on any route(s) selected by the user are plotted on a map, along with the route geometry and stops on the route. A popup on each of the vehicle location markers indicates their current position and how far ahead or behind of schedule they are. 
 * Find A Stop - A map displaying all stops in a region observed by the user, with any stops that are on a selected route displayed in a different colour to differentiate them. The map can be re-centered around a search location to help the user locate relevant stops.
 
 In addition to these tools, other functionality has also been built in:
 * Bookmarking to save view states for the multiple real time boards view and live bus locations views
 * Auto-refresh capability on the board
 
 Tools used to build the dashboard:
 * Leaflet and Datatables for rendering maps and tables data
 * OSRM and Nominatim OSM engines for geocoding and route calculation
 * Waiter for loading screens
 * Shinyjs, Shinywidgets and shinycssloaders for custom UI interactivity",2020-03-16T02:08:02Z,Real time data. Well organised code. Clean UI. Deserves something!

So I reworked some previous ideas :) like:
 
 * Sparkline in a valueBox (hope I can make a post about this soon!)
 * Stylize the app so it doesn't look like a usual shiny app.
 
 And join them with some new ones:
 
 * Using the color in the chart subtitle for make more readable the legends.
 * Try using htmlwidgets as background to try make the app more dinamic (wip)
 * Using some nice shinyextensions like shinyWidgets
 
 Packages:
 
 * This app use `tradestatistics` and `economiccomplexity` packages for the data retrieval and get some indicators. Thanks to @pachamaltese for his knowledge.
 * `dplyr`, `purrr` and friends for data processing.
 * `colorfindr` to get the ""main color"" of a country given its flag (this was a fun part, code in the project/repo).
 * `shinydashboard` (yep! is a shiny dashboard app) valueBox es for the win.
 * `shinyWidgets`for some buttons and the nice big pickerInput.
 * `highcharter` for charts.

We expect that the CRI iAtlas will help to accelerate discovery and improve patient outcomes by providing researchers greater access to standardized immunogenomics data to better understand the immunological characteristics of the tumor immune microenvironment and its potential impact on patient responses to immunotherapy.","**Implementation**
 
 iAtlas is a web-based application to enable data exploration for clinicians, biologists, and informaticists and is accessible at www.cri-iatlas.org. All code is openly available on GitHub. 
 
 **Data**
 
 The iAtlas app uses structured data and outputs from Ref.(Thorsson et al., 2018) and the TCGA PanCancer Atlas Initiative (Hutter and Zenklusen, 2018), which harmonized TCGA data, ensuring uniform quality control and sample inclusion, batch effect detection, normalization across platforms, combination mutation calling from multiple centers, and robustly compiled clinical and outcome data. A key source of data is the spreadsheet summarizing tumor-sample and immune characterizations for 10,080 TCGA patient participants of the TCGA, Table S1of Ref.(Thorsson et al., 2018)here termed the ‚ÄúPanImmune Feature Matrix‚Äù. Auxiliary data were sourced from files available on this manuscript‚Äôs data page at the NCI Genomic Data Commons (gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/panimmune), from the TCGA PanCancer Atlas Data Mirror (isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/PanCancer-Atlas-Mirror.html), and from iAtlas Data Manifest sheets. iAtlas data were formatted as data frames (tables) and stored as ‚Äúfeather‚Äù files (github.com/wesm/feather) on the application server for fast loading. Immunogenomics feature extractions were done and standardized in an analogous fashion from publicly available genomics datasets associated with immunotherapy treatment. 
 
 These files are available for download through the GitHub repository for the iAtlas portal (github.com/CRI-iAtlas/shiny-iatlas). 
 
 Annotation and browsing of the PanImmune Feature Matrix: iAtlas includes a Data Description page with details on all variables presented in individual modules, with the ability for users to ‚Äúdrill down‚Äù on related groups of variables to understand how values were derived. Variables are listed in a text-searchable table containing the name of the variable, the ‚ÄòVariable Class‚Äô, the unit (if applicable), and whether the variable is numeric or categorical. A ‚ÄòVariable Class‚Äô is the name of a group of variables that are of similar type and are often the result of one particular analysis. Clicking on a row exposes a list of all variables in the ‚ÄòVariable Class‚Äô, and provides links to text descriptions of the analysis methods used to generate the variables.
 
 **R/Shiny Architecture**
 
 iAtlas is powered by Shiny (Chang et al., 2017). Shiny is a package written in R for the purpose of creating web applications. These applications translate R code into interactive UI and plots for the purpose of data analysis. iAtlas makes extensive use of Shiny Modules(Cheng, 2017) to organize code into decomposable units. Each iAtlas analysis module is designed as a Shiny module, allowing simple integration of new analytical functionality. iAtlas uses the tidyverse(Wickham et al., 2019) family of R packages (e.g., dplyr and tidyr). These functions power the data transformations of internal tabular data that are then used to create the interactive plots and data tables seen through the iAtlas modules. The core iAtlas application is hosted in shinyapps.io.
 
 **Analysis Modules**
 
 The main feature of the iAtlas interface is the iAtlas Explorer which provides several Analysis modules to explore and visualize results. Each module supports a type of analysis, with interactive views and controls to enhance and extend the results and analytics as initially described in our TCGA Pancancer study (Thorsson et al., 2018). The layout of pages and sections within the iAtlas Explorer is driven by the shinydashboard package.
 
 Within each module in iAtlas, results are displayed as ‚ÄòSample Groups‚Äô, corresponding to defined study cohorts. Several ‚ÄòSample Groups‚Äô are pre-loaded in the tool: first, TCGA tumor type (‚ÄòTCGA Study‚Äô), which are the standard TCGA tumor types collected and designated by the TCGA. Second, TCGA tumor subtypes (‚ÄòTCGA Subtype‚Äô), a compendium of further subdivision of TCGA studies into molecular subtypes according to publications by the TCGA Research Network (Colaprico et al., 2016). Finally, a division of tumor samples into distinct patterns of immune response in cancer (‚ÄòImmune Subtypes‚Äô) is provided (Thorsson et al., 2018). We also allow users to upload custom-grouped samples and analyze those with iAtlas modules. The selection of a sample group defines the samples utilized in all analysis modules. For convenience, group annotations can be displayed in visualizations within each module.
 
 Sample Group Overview: View summary information for user-selected sample cohort groups. There are currently three sections: Custom Groups, Group Key, and Group Overlap. Respectively, these sections permit loading of user-defined sample groups, review of detailed annotations of sample groups in a table, and display of overlap between different types of groupings in a mosaic plot.
 Tumor Microenvironment: Explore immune cell proportions in sample groups with two sets of faceted bar charts, one for overall cellular proportions (i.e., leukocyte, stromal, and tumor fraction) and one for computed immune cell proportions (e.g., monocytes, CD8+ T-cells, naive B-cells).
 
 Immune Feature Trends: Visualize how immune readouts vary across sample groups. Violin or box plots show the distribution of individual values across samples in each group, while heatmaps and scatter plots can be used to explore the correlation between any pair of variables within each group. 
 Clinical Outcomes: Quantify the relationship between immune response and disease outcome, in terms of either overall survival (OS) or progression free interval (PFI) (Liu et al., 2018). Results are displayed as Kaplan Meier plots as well as heat maps showing the concordance index between variables and survival. For datasets with response class information (e.g. complete response, partial response, stable disease, progressive disease), immune features can be analyzed for association with response class.
 
 Immunomodulators: Explore the expression of genes coding for immunomodulating proteins (Thorsson et al., 2018), which include therapeutically important immune checkpoint proteins. ‚ÄòImmunomodulators‚Äô are organized by grouping into three categories: ‚ÄòGene Family‚Äô (such as TNF, MHC Class II, Immunoglobulin, or CXC chemokine), ‚ÄòSuper Category‚Äô (such as Ligand, Receptor, or Antigen Presentation) and ‚ÄòImmune Checkpoint‚Äô (classified as Inhibitory or Stimulatory). Violin and box plots are again used to present distributions, and a table provides additional metadata about immunomodulator genes.
 
 Driver Associations: Test and visualize associations between mutations and IO-related response variables. In Ref.(Thorsson et al., 2018) we reported on somatic driver alterations that are correlated with increases or decreases in overall immune cell content, or with the fraction of individual immune cell types. These and other variables can be selected to calculate the significance of relationships in each sample group and view results in a volcano plot.
 TIL Maps: We recently reported on a method to assess which spatial regions of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) whole slide images show evidence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (Saltz et al., 2018). The method, which uses deep learning, was applied to thousands of H&E slides of the TCGA, allowing slides to be characterized in terms of TIL density and patterns.

The tool generates a customizable tracking chart that details the climatological rate of precipitation accumulation over a specified period of time for any location in the continental U.S. This reference chart can be used to assess how wet or dry observed rain gauge values are relative to the climatological record at that location.","Precipitation is the key variable in assessing drought status and tracking changes in drought conditions. Tracking precipitation, though, can be a challenging task in remote areas. One strategy is to deploy rain gauges that can be checked occasionally by reading the gauge directly (reading depth of accumulated rain) or downloading data collected by a datalogger. An additional challenge is to put these observations into a longer-term context and assessing whether or not they represent drought conditions.
 
 This tool creates a reference precipitation climatology for any location by leveraging a spatially continuous, gridded, long-term dataset of daily precipitation estimates for all locations in the continental United States. The reference climatology can be created for any time frame within the year (e.g. summer season) and produces a chart of the typical (i.e. median) cumulative precipitation pattern as well as extremely wet or dry values based on historical data (1981-2018 historical period). A downloadable, printable table is also produced for tracking and manually recording observations in the field. Together the chart and table create a custom logbook for that rain gauge location. When an observation is made in the field, the entry for that date can be compared to the typical and extreme historical values to provide context and inform a possible management decision. For example, if the reference chart and table indicate that an observation is unusually dry for that date and location it could support triggering management actions specified in a drought plan.
 
 The app also makes the raw data used in the calculation of the precipitation statistics available for exploration on the 'Explore the Data' tab. Individual years of cumulative daily precipitation for the specified season are displayed on interactive plots that can be used to identify extreme years and track near-real-time values. A map that shows the extent of the climate grid as well for reference to the chosen location.",2020-03-04T21:51:41Z,Download indicator is nice

Risk of bias assessment - evaluation of whether the results of a study are likely to be subject to bias - often forms a key part of the evidence synthesis process, particularly in the health sciences. A well-developed family of tools is widely used for this purpose, all of which assign a judgement (e.g. ‚ÄúCritical‚Äù, ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù, Moderate‚Äù, or ‚ÄúLow‚Äù risk of bias) across a number of specific domains of bias. As an example, the first domain in the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for assessing randomized controlled trials deals with bias arising from the randomization process. Two plots are commonly used to summarize the results of these domain-based risk-of-bias assessments: a ‚Äútraffic light‚Äù plot, which tabulates the judgement for each study in each domain (shown in the screenshot below), and a weighted bar plot, which show the proportion of studies with each judgement for each domain.
 
 The `robvis` (Risk Of Bias VISualiation) web-app allows users to create publication-quality versions of these risk-of-bias plots quickly and easily. While primarily designed for use with the major risk-of-bias assessment tools used in health research, the tool allows users to visualize the results from any domain-based risk-of-bias assessment or quality appraisal tool.
 
 Key features of the app include:
 * Example datasets for each risk-of-bias assessment tool supported by the app are provided. Alternatively, users can enter their data into the app manually.
 * Uploaded data go through validation checks, with informative error messages. Users are unable to proceed to plot creation until any issues identified in the data have been resolved.
 * A dynamic user-interface which guides users through the process, while a pop-up containing relevant guidance is available at each stage.
 * A range of options are available to customize the plots (see screenshot)

A Clinically Oriented antimicrobial Resistance Network (ACORN) is a Wellcome funded project led by the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit and the Oxford University of Oxford Clinical Research Unit. Sensitive data can't be shared but the option of using a ""Demo Dataset"" is provided in the App.","**What is ACORN?** ACORN is a Wellcome funded project led by the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU) and the Oxford University of Oxford Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU). The pilot phase of ACORN will focus on development, implementation and assessment of enhanced antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance, including collection of relevant clinical metadata and denominators, as part of routine clinical care in three hospitals in southeast Asia.
 
 **Why is ACORN needed?** Existing AMR surveillance systems are based mostly on diagnostic microbiology laboratory antimicrobial susceptibility testing results alone, which limits interpretability of resistant proportions. Resulting data fail to give relevant feedback for treatment decisions for local clinicians and do not allow for direct assessment and subsequent modelling of the clinically relevant impacts and burden of drug resistant infections (DRI). Tools to capture and analyse AMR data in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) are scarce, which hinders engagement with and use of available data.
 To fill these gaps, the major aim of ACORN is to develop and test a comprehensive data capture system for patient-focussed AMR surveillance in LMIC settings. Surveillance will include diagnostic stewardship activities. Data collected will harmonise with and expand on the pathogen-focussed WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System to enable accurate classification of infection syndromes and patient outcomes. These data will be of critical importance to estimate syndromic and/or pathogen outcomes and associated costs: i.e. how many people die from DRIs and how much does AMR cost?
 
 **Where is ACORN surveillance being done?** The ACORN pilot will occur at Angkor Hospital for Children (Siem Reap, Cambodia), Mahosot Hospital (Vientiane, Lao PDR), and the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases (Hanoi, Vietnam).

Aneuvis is the first user-friendly web application to help researchers identify the genetic and environmental perturbations that promote NCV.","## Overview
 
 **aneuvis** is a web-based tool to automatically analyze numerical chromosomal variation in single cells.
 
 A 6 minute [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWwBYFNb2PA) demonstrating the usage of aneuvis is available. 
 
 A manuscript describing the app was published in BMC Bioinformatics ([Piqu√© et al 2019]( https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-2842-1)) and contains details about the app along with a worked example. 
 
 ## Key features
 
 A schematic of the features of aneuvis is shown below:
 
 [insert overview image here]
 
 Aneuvis facilitates the analysis of numerical chromosomal variation between experimental treatment groups and works downstream of existing approaches that quantify copy number changes in single cells.
 
 ## Input and output
 
 **Input**: The aneuvis workflow begins with the upload of one of three types of single cell chromosomal data (sc-WGS, FISH, or SKY) via a graphical user interface
 
 **Output**: Upon clicking the submit button, aneuvis automatically generates output that is divided into three sections ‚Äì table summary, visualization, and hypothesis testing ‚Äì that are listed along the navigation bar within aneuvis.
 
 - The table summary section quantifies the degree of chromosomal variability per experimental group using six different literature-derived statistics (see Table 1 for a description of the statistics). 
 
 - The visualization section used the statistics shown in table summary, aneuvis automatically generates visualizations that compare experimental groups and that are data type-specific
 
 - The hypothesis testing section uses permutation testing to ask whether two or more treatment groups are different from each other in terms of their degree of numerical chromosomal variability.",2020-02-28T08:45:56Z,"Not sure it would win any awards for shiny app design, but as a domain application.

 ## Quick reading: Highlights
 
 The bar chart race is an awesome visualization tool that provides the evolution of a numerical variable along the time by groups. It is possible to observe how several groups evolve and the competition among them.
 
 There are several tools available to create bar chart races. However, there is no standard tool to create such kind of plot in R. Therefore, we use a [D3 implementation](https://bl.ocks.org/jrzief/70f1f8a5d066a286da3a1e699823470f) provided by [Joel Zief](https://bl.ocks.org/jrzief) and after some customization, we were able to use it as a template for the _r2d3_ package.
 
 Our tool provides three examples as well as a tab in which the user can introduce their own dataset to create a bar chart race. For each example, the user can set up some parameters as the number of bars, the transition speed, and the mood. The latter provides a palette and a song for a selected mood, helping to create an atmosphere.
 
 ## COVID-19 bar chart race
 
 The bar chart race is based on the daily counts of new cases, deaths and recovered individuals provided by the [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) for the new COVID-19 (coronavirus).
 
 ## Brands' value bar chart race
 
 It is a very common example of bar char races. The data is provided by [Interbrand](https://www.interbrand.com/best-brands/) and presents the brand value for several brands around the world showing its evolution over time.
 
 ## Most downloaded R packages in 2019

 I'm not one of those people. I have a deep affinity for thoroughly engineered solutions to trivial problems, and to that end I created a data set suitable for machine learning from recipes collected from allrecipes.com and trained a model to predict whether a given recipe was or was not pancakes.
 
 The app building process posed two primary challenges. The first was building an interface that would accept an arbitrary number of inputs determined by the user. The second, self-imposed, was a desire to have a highly customized and polished UI. The first was achieved through the use of modules and lapply, the second with the help of the excellent w3schools.com.

This app is based on POMA R package (https://pcastellanoescuder.github.io/POMA/) and its hosted in http://polcastellano.shinyapps.io/POMA/.,"**MOTIVATION:**
 
 Like other high-throughput technologies, mass spectrometry usually faces a data mining challenge to provide an understandable and useful output to advance in biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Usually, mass spectrometry data is treated by univariate statistical analyses or by multivariate methods (supervised and unsupervised).
 
 At the same way, biological interpretation of the results is one of the hard points and high knowledge of statistical analysis and computational programming is usually required. For this reason, several bioinformatics tools have emerged to simplify and improve the interpretation and understanding of the results. However, sometimes these tools don't accept complex databases, for example, those that have several covariates.
 
 **RESULTS:**
 
 Here we propose a free, friendly and fast online Shiny interface for the analyses and visualization of mass spectrometry data.
 
 POMA allows users to go from the raw data to statistical analyses. The four main blocks of the analysis are the ‚ÄúLoad Data‚Äù panel (where users can upload their data and an optional file of covariates), ‚ÄúPre-processing‚Äù panel (that includes missing value imputation and normalization), ""Summary Plots"" panel (where users can visualize their data with interactive volcano plots, boxplots and heatmaps) and ‚ÄúStatistical analysis‚Äù (that include univariate and multivariate methods, correlation analysis, feature selection methods such as Lasso and Ridge regression, random forest, rank products, etc.). All these steps also include multiple types of interactive data visualization integrated in an intuitive user interface that no require programming skills to be used.

This can be used to help you or students study and memorize important information!,"The goal of shinyFlash is to provide easy to use, interactive flash cards to help you study! This package contains one primary function: `flash_cards`. This function will allow you to generate flash cards either in a shiny app or in an interactive RStudio addin. 
 
 ## Installation
 
 You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
 
 ```
 # install.packages(""remotes"")
 remotes::install_github(""tbradley1013/shinyFlash"")
 ```
 ## Example
 
 There are two main ways to use the `shinyFlash` pacakge. The first method is through a shiny application and the second is through an interactive RStudio Addin. Both implementations have the same effect although the shiny app has the ability to interactively upload different datasets in the same session. 
 
 ```{r load-package}
 library(shinyFlash)
 ```
 
 ### RStudio Modal
 
 The default mode for the flash cards (i.e. `type = ""local""`) will result in the flash cards appearing as a modal in your RStudio window. If `type = ""local""` then the user must specify a data frame using the `.data` argument or the path to a valid file with the `path` argument. Whichever is specified, the user must specify the names of the columns that make up the questions and answers. By default, it will look for columns named `question` and `answer`, but the user can change the column it looks for using the arguments `question` and `answer`. 
 
 ```r
 flash_cards(shinyFlash::adv_r_deck)
 ```
 
 ![](man/readme/flash-cards-default.gif)
 
 ### Shiny app
 
 The shiny app can be launched using the `flash_cards` function:
 
 ```r
 flash_cards(type = ""shiny"")
 ```
 
 If the function is called without specifying the `.data` or `path` arguments, the app will launch and present the user with a dialog box that can be used to select one of the two default card decks or upload a custom dataset. If the user chooses to upload a custom dataset, it must be either an `.xlsx`, `.rds`, or `.csv` file and the user must specify the column names that contain the question and answer, respectively.
 
 Users can also specify a dataset to the `flash_cards` dataset using either the `.data` or `path` arguments. Just like when specifying a dataset using the shiny application, the specified dataset must have the columns `question` and `answer`. If specifying a path, it must be either a `.xlsx`, `.csv`, or `.rds` file. 
 
 ![](man/readme/flash-cards-shiny.gif)
 
 ### Flash Deck Data
 
 Valid flash card decks must have a question and answer column. By default, the functions in this package will look for the columns named `question` and `answer`. However, the user can specify different column names using the `question` and `answer` function arguments. The only requirement for these columns is that they must be characters. 
 
 Questions can be repeated multiple times in a dataset with different answers. If this occurs, the function will group together those questions and list them as bullets on the back side of a single flash card.
 
 The qustion and answer columns can also contain HTML tags which will then be interpretted as HTML within the program. 
 
 
 ### RStudio Addin
 
 This package also comes with three RStudio Addins. Both of these functions call versions of the local flash cards, but differ in the way the user specifies the dataset to be used. 
 
 The first addin, `shinyFlash`, will look through the Global Environment for all objects that are valid flash card decks (i.e. data.frames with columns named `question` and `answer`. If there is only one valid flash card deck then the addin will launch using this dataset. If there are multiple valid flash card decks, then the user will be asked to specify which dataset they would like to use in the console. 
 
 The second addin, `shinyFlash (custom column names)`, will look through the Global Environment for valid flash card decks similar to the first addin. However this addin, as suggested by the name, will allow for users to specify the question and answer column names as something other than the `question` and `answer`.
 
 The third addin, `shinyFlash (file)`, will result in a file system dialog to appear and allow the user to select the file that they wish to uplaod to the function, as if through the `path` argument.

It provides functions to create, import and check relational data models. These functions are accessible through a graphical user interface made with Shiny.","# Description
 
 The ReDaMoR package allows the manipulation of relational data models in R. It provides functions to create, import and save relational data models. These functions are accessible through a graphical user interface made with [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).
 
 A plublic instance of the Shiny app is available [here](https://pgodard.shinyapps.io/ReDaMoR).
 
 The main features of ReDaMoR are the following:
 
 - Create data model from scratch with a graphical user interface
 - Save data model in a json format
 - Import SQL data model generated with [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)
 - Document data types as R types (character, numeric, logical, ‚Ä¶)
 - Add comments to tables and fields to improve model documentation
 - Check and auto-correct model constraints (types, keys, uniqueness, mandatory fields)
 - Confront data to the model to check their compatibility
 
 The package can also be tested in [Rstudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/project/1033803).
 
 ```
 library(ReDaMoR)
 m <- model_relational_data()
 ```
 
 You can also run the code documented in the [package vignette](https://patzaw.github.io/ReDaMoR/ReDaMoR.html).

 Triple I came about because there are many separate pieces of evidence about how specific interventions affect the health of individuals, but relatively little evidence about how these interventions might affect health and health inequalities at the population level. 
 
 It is intended to provide national and local decision makers with interactive tools and interpreted findings to inform discussions and decisions about different interventions. The study will also be of use to anyone with an interest in improving population health and reducing health inequalities.

 Mediate is an experimental web-based application, or app, for doing mediation analysis and obtaining bootstrap confidence intervals. I, Ashwin Malshe, am the sole developer of the app. For any suggestions, comments, concerns, etc., please contact me on ashwin.malshe@utsa.edu
 
 Why use Mediate?
 
 * As Mediate is web-based, all it requires is a computer with Internet connection and a modern browser (e.g., Safari, Chrome, Firefox).
 
 * Mediate is free. It uses the open-source R software to perform mediation analysis. (It requires some funds to host the app on the web but I can afford to pay for it.)
 
 * Mediate has a functional graphical user interface (GUI), which gives you granular control over your analysis without writing any code.
 
 * Mediate shows you all the parameters you used for the analysis including the file name, variable names, random number seed, number of bootstrap samples, and confidence interval. You can simply copy this in a text file for easy replicability.
 
 * Mediate makes mediation plots.
 
 * Mediate allows you to export tables and plots in PDF and Word formats.
 
 * Mediate is secure because it doesn't store your data. After every session, your data is purged from the servers. Mediate currently allows log-in free operation. (I may add the ability to create accounts in the future.)
  
 * Mediate can read data files in various formats including Comma-Separated Values (.csv), Microsoft Excel (.xls, .xlsx), Stata (.dta), SAS (.sas7bdat), and SPSS (.sav). This makes Mediate software-agnostic.",2020-02-13T21:03:43Z,UI isn't great. Unlikely to win. But it does the job.

To visualize how Canada has changed over the years I created a dashboard-like view of six broad indicators. To put each statistic in context, I included other countries, or average or historical values for comparison. Each box has an info tab that has some suggested years to try along with some of my observations and links for further exploration.","For comparison countries I selected:
 
 USA
 
 * Canada‚Äôs closest neighbour and largest trading partner by far. The country Canada most often compares itself to.
 
 Sweden
 
 * Everyone looks to Scandinavia to see the result of a society with a larger social safety net made possible through higher taxes.
 
 Japan
 
 * A modern, technologically advanced but culturally different country. Japan served as a role model for hyper-growth to the four Asian tigers: South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.
 
 OECD
 
 * To minimize the criticism of cherry picking countries let‚Äôs look at a bundle. Conveniently, there is a group of developed countries, nicknamed the rich nations‚Äô club, that fits well here. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) was founded in 1961 with 20 countries and now numbers 36.
 
 The dashboard looks at six areas:
 
 **Population**
 How population growth relates to economic growth is a heavily debated topic in economics. It‚Äôs important because economic growth ties directly to our standard of living. Two third‚Äôs of Canada‚Äôs population growth is from immigration. Read why this is great news here.
 
 **Population Distribution**
 It‚Äôs not just population that factors into a country‚Äôs standard of living. It‚Äôs how the ages are distributed. If everyone is old, who is working, paying taxes and funding social services? Be sure to check out the info tab here to see the birth of the boomer generation.
 
 **Infant Mortality**
 The infant mortality rate is the number of children who die before the age of one for every one thousand live births. It‚Äôs one number that is often used to serve as a proxy for the health of the population as a whole.
 
 **Energy**
 The Canada dashboard gives an historical look at Canada‚Äôs production of oil, coal and natural gas. In fact, it shows data going back to 1925 which you probably haven‚Äôt seen before. Thanks to the super sleuthing efforts of a librarian at Statistics Canada in Ottawa I dusted off the digital files to show Canada‚Äôs early days in the energy sector.
 
 **CO2**
 Climate change is the defining issue of our time and CO2 is a major contributor. Thus, CO2 is an obvious admission to the Canada dashboard.
 
 **Interest Rates**
 Canadian banks set their own prime rate, theoretically independently of one another. However they are all basing their rate on the Bank of Canada‚Äôs policy interest rate or overnight rate.
 
 The goal of the Bank of Canada when it comes to setting their overnight rate is keeping inflation under control.
 
 Interestingly, the level of employment is not an official concern of the Bank of Canada‚Äôs monetary policy. Whereas with the Federal Reserve, America‚Äôs central bank, employment gets a mention in word, if not always in spirit.
 
 **Final Thoughts on a Quantified World**
 I ran across some cautionary advice when trying to understand complex things through numbers alone. These authors expand on the famous quote, ‚ÄúNot everything that counts can be counted.‚Äù
 
 > We have implemented policies that focus narrowly on one value of meaning: We emphasize GDP and efficiency, those things that we can measure, leaving behind the value of those that are harder to quantify - like community, happiness friendships, pride, and integration.

Meta-analysis (M-A) is used to synthesise the results of multiple diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) studies to establish their accuracy. Statistical methods for such analyses use relatively complex models which can be a barrier for non-statisticians. MetaDTA is an online application which allows a range of stakeholders to interactively conduct, explore and visually examine results of DTA M-A and facilitate sensitivity analyses.","**Why was MetaDTA developed?**
 
 MetaDTA was developed by the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Complex Review Support Unit (http://www.nihrcrsu.org/guidance/apps/) whose remit is to improve the value of systematic reviews which the NIHR funded. It became apparent that lack of accessible user-friendly software was a major stumbling block for health researchers without advanced statistical expertise with respect to carrying out state-of-the-science analyses such as diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) meta-analysis (M-A). It was decided that a Shiny app would be the most effective solution to this problem. We have received excellent feedback on MetaDTA and know it is getting 100s of hours use each month by researchers in many areas of the world, including those in low and middle income countries. In addition to its primary function of allowing non-statistical experts to do research using DTA M-A, we get enthusiastic reports from statisticians who use it because of its ease and efficiency and educators who use it as a practical teaching tool in the classroom. The Cochrane Collaboration (www.cochrane.org), whose work is internationally recognised as a benchmark for high-quality information about the effectiveness of healthcare, have expressed interest in including the app within the software chapter of their DTA M-A handbook. An open-access research article on MetaDTA was published in the journal BMC Medical Research Methodology in April 2019 and is available at https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-019-0724-x.
 
 **What does MetaDTA do?**
 
 MetaDTA conducts M-A of DTA studies using a bivariate model, and displays the individual study and M-A results using a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve. As well as carrying out analyses, data and results are presented graphically. MetaDTA provides multiple displays for exploring data interactively. Exploration of the robustness of results is encouraged by the ability to explore the impact of excluding specific studies in the evidence base directly within the interface and the option to display those results alongside the results from all studies on the dedicated ‚Äò Sensitivity Analysis‚Äô page. 
 
 There is often variation between DTA studies within an M-A and identifying why studies disagree is an important part of the M-A process. To facilitate the understanding of variation between studies MetaDTA allows visualisation of study-level covariates alongside the SROC curve, including markers of study quality from the QUADAS-2 tool (https://www.bristol.ac.uk/population-health-sciences/projects/quadas/quadas-2/). The graphical display adapts to the simultaneous presentation of covariates and study quality and includes novel plots of multiple dimensions of study quality from QUADAS-2. High quality graphical output can be downloaded from MetaDTA for inclusion in written reports. 
 
 MetaDTA leverages features from 22 existing R packages as well as bespoke code to deliver an accessible interactive analysis solution. For more information on the range of features available within MetaDTA and how to use MetaDTA please see the User Guide available to download from the MetaDTA home page (https://crsu.shinyapps.io/dta_ma/).
 
 **What is diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis?**
 
 Medical diagnostic tests aim to distinguish between people with and without a condition of interest, often a disease. Diagnostic testing is ubiquitous in healthcare informing treatment decisions and determining care pathways. M-A is a statistical method of synthesising the results of multiple DTA studies to establish their accuracy. In an era of evidence based medicine meta-analyses of DTA studies often represent the best available clinical evidence for the recommended diagnostic tests routinely used in practice. MetaDTA provides a unique tool allowing researchers and patients alike to scrutinise the clinical evidence behind the healthcare decision making process.
 
 To assess accuracy, a diagnostic test is compared to the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù test which is assumed to provide the true diagnosis of individuals and two parameters, sensitivity and specificity, are calculated. Sensitivity is the ability of the diagnostic test to correctly identify patients with the disease amongst patients who have the disease. Specificity is the ability of the diagnostic test to correctly identify the healthy individuals amongst patients who do not have the disease. A DTA M-A synthesises both sensitivity and specificity taking into account the correlation between them. Recommended statistical approaches are either the bivariate or hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) models. Without covariates, these two approaches are mathematically equivalent. MetaDTA uses the bivariate model to estimate sensitivity and specificity across all studies and uses the bivariate model parameters to calculate the HSROC model parameters which are then used to plot the SROC curve. 
 
 **Who is MetaDTA for?**
 
 Due to the rich feature-set and user-friendliness of the software MetaDTA should appeal to a wide audience including those without specialist statistical knowledge. MetaDTA contains four datasets from a real-life systematic review in dementia for users to explore and discover the range of options available.

Welcome to Kupe your data explorer provided by Te Hiringa Hauora, the Health Promotion Agency (HPA). Kupe lets you explore Health and Lifestyles Survey data about New Zealanders' views and experiences across several topics. The name, Kupe, is inspired by the chiefly Polynesian navigator and fisherman who, according to MƒÅori oral tradition, discovered the islands of Aotearoa, New Zealand. After some difficulty catching fish off the coast of his homeland in Hawaiki, Kupe learnt of a giant wheke (octopus) eating the bait from his fishing hooks. Kupe set out to capture the troublesome octopus which led to a great pursuit across the Pacific Ocean, bringing Kupe and his followers to Aotearoa, New Zealand.","Kupe presents results from the most recent survey, as well as changes over time for adults aged 15 years and over. Kupe aims to answer the following questions for each reported indicator:
 
 1. What is the prevalence (percentage) and estimated number of people affected, or what is the average (mean) for the total population and population subgroups?
 
 2. How do the indicators vary by sex, age, ethnicity, or neighbourhood deprivation? Ratios are used to compare males with females, MƒÅori with non-MƒÅori, Pacific with non-Pacific, and people living in most deprived versus least deprived areas. Ratios are adjusted for differences in age, sex, and prioritised ethnicity.
 
 3. What has changed over time? Where possible, we present results for all available years of the HLS to identify significant changes over time.
 
 **THE SURVEY**
 Health and Lifestyles Survey (HLS) data was first collected in 2008 by the Health Sponsorship Council (HSC). Before 2008 the HSC had a range of standalone surveys including Smokefree/Auahi Kore Monitor, Gaming and Betting Activities Survey and the Sun Protection Triennial Survey. In 2008, these surveys were combined into one survey - the HLS.
 
 Face-to-face interviews for the HLS have been completed every two years since 2008.
 
 The main target populations are adults aged 15 years and over, and parents and caregivers of 5 to 16-year-old children living in permanent private dwellings in New Zealand. Each survey year monitors changes in attitudes, knowledge and behaviours, and tracks changes in views about the social desirability and acceptability of various measures. The HLS includes questions about gambling, tobacco, alcohol, sun exposure, nutrition, mental health, and physical activity. Sections and questions vary across the survey years.

 > I have built this application from multiple open source versions of data and analyses to a constructive website displaying real time updates about Corona Out-break and Covid-19 Disease Real Time Statistics.
 
 **Background**
 In December 2019, cases of severe respiratory illness began to be reported across the city of Wuhan in China. These were caused by a new type of coronavirus, and the disease is now commonly referred to as COVID-19. The number of COVID-19 cases started to escalate more quickly in mid-January and the virus soon spread beyond China‚Äôs borders. This story has been rapidly evolving ever since, and each day we are faced by worrying headlines regarding the current state of the outbreak.
 
 In isolation, these headlines can be hard to interpret. How fast is the virus spreading? Are efforts to control the disease working? How does the situation compare with previous epidemics? This site is updated daily based on data published by Johns Hopkins University. By looking beyond the headlines, we hope it is possible to get a deeper understanding of this unfolding pandemic.

I am currently living in Europe and have been fortunate to travel frequently. Before I visit a new city, I like to make a list of museums, specialty coffee roasters and cafes, and breweries. This allows me to make detailed travel itineraries so I can make the most out of my trip. However, this can be very time-consuming. I wanted an app where I could look at all potential destinations at once and view them on a map. I searched for other apps and projects but didn't find anything that suited my needs. So, like any other data scientist or web developer would do, I decided to create my own app: `shinyTravel`.
 
 The `shinyTravel` app is a data-driven shiny app that provides European travel recommendations based on users' preference for visting breweries, museums, and cafes with specialty coffee. Users rate how important it is to visit these locations while traveling using a scale of *Not at all important* to *Essential*. Based on how the user rates each location type, they will receive a list of three recommended European cities. Users can limit the search to specific countries and can exclude the larger cities from the results. They can also explore all locations using an interactive map and view summarized data tables.
 
 The `shinyTravel` app demonstrates how to design and develop a shiny application from scratch (i.e., shiny beyond bootstrap).

The app uses the magick library to overlay images of keyboard layouts, and the image overlay can be downloaded and printed out to actual scale for comparison in the physical world.","This app was built for the DIY ergonomic keyboard community (see https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/).
 
 Many of us spend hours every day typing away at our computers, which can lead to multiple health issues such as Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). Using a ""split"" keyboard offers an ergonomic solution, but finding which keyboard is right for you can be costly and difficult. Most split keyboards come as DIY kits, making it difficult (if not impossible) to compare different keyboard layouts prior to building them. This app offers a solution to this problem.
 
 Using the magick library, this app overlays images of different keyboard layouts of the user's choosing. The app dynamically changes the colors of each keyboard image in real time to help identify the contours of each different keyboard. The app also has a ""print"" button that inserts the image overlay into an RMarkdown file that is then compiled into a PDF. When printed, the image is accurate to true scale in the physical world. Finally, the app contains several filtering options for the keyboards, such as the degree of stagger across the key columns and whether or not the keyboard has a number row at the top.
 
 Perhaps one of the most unique aspects of this app is that it is not used to display data in the traditional sense. There are no analyses or plots, but the images shown are incredibly useful for the intended audience (i.e. the community of ergonomic keyboard users and hobbyists). The app highlights the power of libraries like magick for image manipulation in R and the flexibility of the R ecosystem by enabling the manipulated image to be inserted into a RMarkdown document and converted into a true-to-scale PDF.",2020-03-19T20:31:29Z,"Niche application, but cool UI, good use of custom HTML.

 Over the next few decades, global climate is expected to undergo a dramatic transformation in an ongoing response to greenhouse gas emissions. What do we expect future climate to feel like and how might this change if we reduce emissions?
 
 We answer these questions by finding the present-day location that has a climate most similar to that expected by the 2080‚Äôs in each of 540 cities (shown as purple dots on the map). We do this for different rates of emissions and a variety of climate models.
 
 We used 12 different measures to describe climate, including minimum and maximum temperature and total precipitation for winter, spring, summer and fall. We considered two emissions scenarios ‚Äì one that assumes high current emissions continue and one that assumes emissions peak mid-century and then decline. We also considered numerous future climate forecasts as generated by 27 different climate models.
 
 An interesting, but not necessarily surprising finding is that there are no perfect matches. In other words, for no city did we find a present-day climate that is identical to a city's climate in 2080. In fact, because of the magnitude of expected climate change, for many cities the ‚Äúbest‚Äù match is not all that similar.

Welcome to Kupe your data explorer provided by Te Hiringa Hauora, the Health Promotion Agency (HPA). Kupe lets you explore Health and Lifestyles Survey data about New Zealanders' views and experiences across several topics. The name, Kupe, is inspired by the chiefly Polynesian navigator and fisherman who, according to MƒÅori oral tradition, discovered the islands of Aotearoa, New Zealand. After some difficulty catching fish off the coast of his homeland in Hawaiki, Kupe learnt of a giant wheke (octopus) eating the bait from his fishing hooks. Kupe set out to capture the troublesome octopus which led to a great pursuit across the Pacific Ocean, bringing Kupe and his followers to Aotearoa, New Zealand.","**KUPE - THE DATA EXPLORER**
 Kupe presents results from the most recent survey, as well as changes over time for adults aged 15 years and over. Kupe aims to answer the following questions for each reported indicator:
 
 1. What is the prevalence (percentage) and estimated number of people affected, or what is the average (mean) for the total population and population subgroups?
 
 2. How do the indicators vary by sex, age, ethnicity, or neighbourhood deprivation? Ratios are used to compare males with females, MƒÅori with non-MƒÅori, Pacific with non-Pacific, and people living in most deprived versus least deprived areas. Ratios are adjusted for differences in age, sex, and prioritised ethnicity.
 
 3. What has changed over time? Where possible, we present results for all available years of the HLS to identify significant changes over time.
 
 **THE SURVEY**
 Health and Lifestyles Survey (HLS) data was first collected in 2008 by the Health Sponsorship Council (HSC). Before 2008 the HSC had a range of standalone surveys including Smokefree/Auahi Kore Monitor, Gaming and Betting Activities Survey and the Sun Protection Triennial Survey. In 2008, these surveys were combined into one survey - the HLS.
 
 Face-to-face interviews for the HLS have been completed every two years since 2008.
 
 The main target populations are adults aged 15 years and over, and parents and caregivers of 5 to 16-year-old children living in permanent private dwellings in New Zealand. Each survey year monitors changes in attitudes, knowledge and behaviours, and tracks changes in views about the social desirability and acceptability of various measures. The HLS includes questions about gambling, tobacco, alcohol, sun exposure, nutrition, mental health, and physical activity. Sections and questions vary across the survey years.

 The point of having a portfolio is to achieve diversification, so this app measures that directly. How much of the risk of each holding is kept vs. diversified away by the portfolio. No matter how diverse your portfolio, you cannot diversify away all risk. There is systemic risk, which drives all asset prices to some degree or another. The market in theory compensates you for holding risk that no portfolio could diversify away, and that is where expected return comes from.

This serves as an input for the design and impact evaluation of public policy. Also, based on the premise that there is an association between socioeconomic level and electoral behavior, it may be helpful for electoral analysis and strategies. In a few words, the main purpose of the tool is to carry out more precise and exhaustive diagnoses that serve to a better understanding of how politics works and how to design public policy.
 
 Based on disaggregated data from the 2010 National Census (INDEC, 2012) we elaborated an index that summarizes a large volume of information in a census radius level for the entire territory of Argentina.
 
 The final database we worked with consisted of 52,272 observations (census radius ‚Äì the smallest unit of territory in which the country is distributed) that grouped information from more than 12 million households (hhs) and more than 41.4 million registered people. With this data, we performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality. 
 
 We used structural variables (such as the housing conditions) and social variables (such as the highest degree reached by the householder):
 
 1) % of hhs with employed householder;
 2) % of hhs with at least one Unmet Basic Needs (NBI); 
 3) % of women;
 4) % of hhs with a householder who has at least a high school degree; 
 5) % of hhs with poor housing conditions;
 6) Mean age; 
 7) Median age.
 
 
 PCA statistical technique consists of obtaining as much information as possible from a data set by constructing latent variables from the existing variables in which correlations are observed and reducing the dimensionality of the phenomenon. The components are linear combinations of the original variables and only a few are expected to collect most of the variability of the data.
 
 The PCA results from the selected data show that approximately 67% of the variability can be explained by the first two components. With them, we were able to obtain two indices (main and secondary) where we can explore distinctive socioeconomic characteristics of the population for each census radio in all districts within each of Argentina's 24 provinces. High values of the index represent better socioeconomic conditions and low values the opposite. 
 
 The main index explains almost half of the total variability (47%) of the data set and describes, in a single variable, the socioeconomic characteristics of the population for each census radius. High scores in the radius are those with a low percentage of households with at least one Unmet Basi Need (NBI in Spanish) and houses with poor housing conditions. Similarly they householders who have at least a high school degree and higher average age and women proportion. This is also consistent with smaller average-sized households.
 
 The application starts with a display of an Argentina map and a drop-down menu that allows you to select the territory to be analyzed, first selecting a province and then a district. The cartographic division within each of the districts is the census radius.
 
 In the lower-left corner, the range of observed values of the Socioeconomic Index in that territory is plotted (from a possible range that varies between a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 5). The ranges are related to a color palette with which the census radius is filled. 
 
 The map also makes it possible to display a popup with summary information about the selected census radius. These are unique identifiers (fraction and census radius, according to the INDEC nomenclator) and the number of registered population and households. 
 
 Another useful element is found in the filters of the Index (at the bottom end of the drop-down menu). There we can set values within the range that is printed when selecting each district and the result will be to present the only radius that meets the condition.
 
 Finally, the application also allows you to explore the indicators from a table with all the observations for the entire country, with the additional possibility of filtering by certain values of interest.",2020-03-12T20:36:49Z,Nice use of maps that zoom to a region based on what select from drop down.

This is a fairly common problem; the identification of a mineral based on it's chemistry is a difficult task. Hopefully MICA can make it a bit easier!,"*MICA* is built from the database of minerals at webmineral.com which consists of 4722 minerals. The composition of 85 elements for each mineral is recorded in the database.
 
 **Finding similar minerals**
 Comparing minerals in 85-dimension space would be an challenging task. So using the UMAP algorithm (implemented in the uwot R package), we reduce the dimensionality of the data to three dimensions. Now that our data is in 3D, we can visually assess similar groups of minerals and identify naturally occuring relationships between groups of minerals.
 
 **Creating natural groups of minerals**
 We use the DBSCAN R package to perform density-based clustering on the reduced-dimensionality mineral data. This gives us a bunch of clusters whos constituent minerals have similar chemical compositions.
 
 *MICA* shows you a list of the minerals in a selected cluster, along with their associated chemical formula.
 
 **Importance of elements within clusters**
 Being able to quickly assess the importance of certain elements within a group of minerals can be informative.
 
 We use the randomForest R package to build an unsupervised random forest model, purely for investigating feature importance. The mean decrease in the Gini index for each element is ranked and displayed.

 This app was developed to make the data and key visualisations of COVID-19 trends available to everyone and also provide a platform for further detailed analysis of the trends.
 
 **Methodology**
 
 The data is sourced from the code developed by Tim Churches (UNSW) which extracts data from Johns Hopkins University . In addition, we sourced data about country and province/state population from Wikipedia.
 
 This application differs from other COVID-19 applications by focusing on number of days since the first cases report from each selected country instead of calendar dates. Using this application, countries can be compared easily based on their actual and per capita performance as the Y-axis scale is logged.
 
 In addition, the application allows linear regression and smoothing patterns for selected countries, and compare the growth rate with a fixed growth rate.
 
 
 **Main Packages**
 
 We used shiny and shinyWidgets for the mainframe of the application, used tidyverse, and lubridate to prepare data, and applied scales, ggrepel to improve the readability of visualisations. 
 
 **Limitations**
 
 Data source may contain information that we could not explain. For example, Japan had a minor drop in their cumulative trend between 2020-01-22 and 2020-01-23. Also, the number of cases is highly driven by the testing practices across countries so we focused on confirmed cases at the moment, however death and recovery trends are also added.
 
 **Contribution**
 
 We aware that teams at the World Bank and Red Cross, and few other organisations are following the app updates to inform their COVID-19 impact analysis. 
 
 **Acknowledgements** 
 
 We acknowledge and appreciate the support that the RStudio team provided by offering an unlimited access account for this application, and Time Churches (UNSW) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU) for data sharing.

Using Covid-O-Meter, users can calculate and visualise the number of cases and deaths, daily case and death growth rate, and case fatality rate per country. The interactivity allows users to quickly explore and compare statistics from different combinations of countries and adjust various parameters to tune the graphs.","### Background
 
 The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is a complex problem which has affected the lives of many people and destabilized foundations of societies worldwide. Since the beginning of the outbreak, the The Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at John Hopkins University has been collecting daily updated data on the number of cases and deaths related to Covid-19 from various almost all affected regions and countries worldwide.
 
 This valuable dataset has been utilised to build visualisations, mathematical models, and various statistics of the disease spread over time. Each of these projects has its own perks and tells a different story. For a rapidly evolving problem such as Covid-19, however, narratives on specific topics on certain populations or areas at certain periods may not always fit well in other contexts. A combination of domain expertise and local knowledge is often required to make sense of a specific subset of the data.
 
 To aid this time-consuming data sleuthing work, Covid-O-Meter provides a simple web-based dashboard which allows users with relevant expertise to navigate through different parts of the dataset directly so that they can make their own discoveries. The scale of the data combined with the accessibility and flexibility of Covid-O-Meter makes it easy to calculate and keep track of country-specific key statistics at a certain period of time ‚Äì a powerful feature for any user, particularly those with little experience in infectious disease epidemiology or in a resource-limited settings.
 
 ### Contents
 As per April 2, 2020, Covid-O-Meter can provide the following information:
 
 #### Case statistics
 * Cumulative Number of cases
 * Number of new cases
 
 #### Death statistics
 * Cumulative number of deaths
 * Number of new deaths
 * Case fatality rate = Number of deaths (cumulative) / Number of cases (cumulative)
 
 #### Animation
 * Number of cases (per-day time-lapse)
 * Number of deaths (per-day time-lapse)
 
 ### Plots
 
 Covid-O-Meter combines powerful features from `shiny`, `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, and `ggiraph` packages to create interactive visualisations. Extension packages such as `ggrepel`, `ggthemes`, `shinyWidgets`, and `shinycustomloader` are added to improve user experience. 
 
 Plots in Covid-O-Meter are a combination scatter plot and line chart on a two axes Cartesian coordinate system.
 
 The *Y-axis* represents the corresponding statistics on a log base 2 scale (number of cases / deaths) or a linear scale (daily case / death growth rate and case fatality rate). The logarithmic base 2 scale is used to represent the doubling rate of the number of cases / deaths due to the exponential nature of the disease spread.
 
 The *X-axis* represents day after first *N* cases (for case statistics) / deaths (for death statistics) on a one-unit increase linear scale, with *N* being the minimum number of cases / deaths to count as day 1. 
 
 #### Interactive elements
 
 On mouse hover, each data point will show country name, date, day after first N cases / deaths (X-axis coordinate), and value of the statistics (Y-axis coordinate).
 
 The draggable sidebar allows users to adjust various data and plot parameters, including:
 * Add / remove countries
 * Adjust range of dates to use in calculation 
 * Adjust minimum number of cases / deaths to be counted as Day 1 
 * Adjust range of days to display
 * Change between linear / log scale
 * Show doubling rate
 
 All plots can also be downloaded as a static image.
 
 ### Animation
 Covid-O-Meter uses the `gganimate` package to produce an animated gif of per-day time lapse of the cumulative number of cases / deaths. Users can freely adjust countries and plot parameters, create their own animation, and save it to a local machine.",2020-04-03T05:20:41Z,"OK COVID-19 app, but plots are cluttered and difficult to decode.

Dynamic reporting is implemented to allows users to create reports of their results.

The use of dynamic dashboards, dynamic reporting, interactive visualizations and voice-enabled analytics using various bioinformatics tools will enable and expedite a thorough interrogation of omics datasets.","I learned about the Shiny contest a week before the March deadline and decided it would be an excellent opportunity to demonstrate a proof of concept of another app I am developing called, Omics Central (https://github.com/singha53/singha53.github.io/blob/source/src/assets/img/portfolio/omicsCentral_poster.pdf). R Shiny is what really motivated me to become a developer and learn industry standards such as React and AWS. Omics Central uses a serverless stack; the React front-end is hosted on S3, whereas the backend is completely based on AWS services. Its need really arose from bioinformatics analysis that are compute intensive such as hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models. Therefore, users simply upload their data and select the analysis they want to run and submit the job, which runs Docker containers consisting of R/Python scripts and the results are saved to DynamoDB and S3. Then it‚Äôs a matter of querying the databases and visualizing the plots. This app is under construction‚Ä¶
 
 For this contest I decided to recycle an app I made for a publication 2 years ago which really got my journey as a developer rolling (https://amritsingh.shinyapps.io/multiomics_HFhospitalizations/). The purpose of this Shiny app was to allow readers to reproduce the results of my paper (Singh et al., CJC 2019). I wanted to just extend the app so that it would take in user data and run through the same set of analysis. However, one thing led to another and given the two-week extension, I was able to extend the app in a number of ways:
 1) I wanted to make it easier to write up reports using the app so I add a dynamic reporting feature (the shiny gallery was very helpful), where users can create different sections of documents (e.g. introduction, methods etc) and add figures and tables and generate a word document that they can share.
 2) Originally the app was designed for two-group comparisons, however, I came across a COVID-19 transcriptomics dataset which motivated me to extend some features of the app such as statistical inference and differential expression analysis to handle more than two categories. I didn‚Äôt have enough time to extend the biomarker discovery analysis to multinomial models, so that is limited to binary classification, although users can decide which two groups from a categorical variable to develop models for. Since this was a COVID-19 transcriptomics dataset, I add drug enrichment functionality to allow for the enrichment of drug candidates that can reverse the gene expression signatures. Potential treatments? Maybe ÔÅä
 3) I have always wanted to see a ggplot on an Alexa device. Therefore, I made a multimodal Alexa Skill to explore the data similar to the web app but by using voice-commands. I have made an Alexa Skill previously as a cool project with my daughter (https://www.amazon.com/SinghIsKing-Kenza-Travels/dp/B08252TBW9), so this wasn‚Äôt too difficult. The cloudyr R-library was useful in sending data to S3 and DynamoDB from R. Currently, this is a very simple Alexa Skill, but can be made much more complex in terms of the voice commands it recognises and types of analyses it can do. This skill does a lot querying from S3 and DynamoDB so I have not submitted it for certification (otherwise I have to incur the cost for use), however I have provided the source code and instructions so users can set it up themselves (https://github.com/singha53/omics-bioanalytics-alexa-skill).
 
 Given all this work, I decided to write it up as a short manuscript which is now submitted to bioRxiv. Not bad for a paper in 3 weeks. Whether it gets published is another story LOL.",2020-04-03T20:03:00Z,"Seems to be an automatic report generator, but required downloading and re-uploading Zip file of data to try it out, which doesn't seem secure."

If you have to change a lot of variables each time, it's time to build a shiny app!
 
 Doing my analyse for my PhD project in R was what drove me to build an app for this purpose. I was examining pregnancy rates around the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy launch in England to see what the effects were. I constructed it using all of the potential inputs for various comparative analyses on the left, outputting all the model information and graphs I need to report my findings in my thesis and in papers.
 
 An Interrupted Time Series analysis examines the trend before an intervention and compares with the trend after, to see if a change has taken place which might have been caused by the action. In the simple ITS comparison on loading you can see a significant effect straight away!
 
 Adding controls to an ITS analysis can account for underlying trends, common shocks and other unrelated policy/environmental changes. What happens then when we add unexposed Scotland or Wales to the analysis? Have a go and find out!

Data under-utilization, however remains a major challenge due to specific skill set required for data processing, interpretation, and analysis. To simplify end-user RNA-seq data interpretation, we created RNA-seq DRaMA - an R/Shiny interactive reporting system with user-friendly web interface for data exploration and visualization (https://hssgenomics.shinyapps.io/RNAseq_DRaMA/). The app supports many methods for data exploration including: sample PCA and multidimensional scaling, gene- and sample- correlation analyses, Venn diagram and UpSet set visualizations, gene expression group barplots and heatmaps with hierarchical clustering, volcano plots, pathway analysis with QuSAGE, and Transcription Factor network analysis. All plots are highly customized in terms of sample, feature, threshold, and color selections and create publication-ready pdf and tabular outputs. All features are well-documented with an in-app manual. RNAseq DRaMA has been extensively tested at the HSS Genomics Center with more than 100 projects delivered and several projects currently deployed in the public domain","Decreasing cost of DNA sequencing and improvements in data analysis and interpretation leads to the adoption of RNAseq as the method of choice for large-scale gene expression profiling. Data under-utilization; however, remains a major challenge due to the specific skill set required for data processing, interpretation, and analysis. Collaboration between dedicated bioinformaticians and experimental scientists are often hampered by the lack of cost-effective, easy-to-use data delivery and analytical platforms geared toward practitioners with little computational experience. We created rnaseqDRaMA (RNAseq Data Retrieval and Mining Analytical platform) an interactive reporting system based on R-Shiny that provides a user-friendly web interface for RNAseq data exploration and visualization (https://hssgenomics.shinyapps.io/RNAseq_DRaMA/). 
 
 In design of rnaseqDRaMA we were guided by several goal:
  ‚Ä¢ Compatibility with existing RNA-seq data processing pipelines
  ‚Ä¢ Interactivity via web-based interface
  ‚Ä¢ Consistent user interface
  ‚Ä¢ Customizable graphic and tabular outputs
 
 ![](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/rnaseqDrama_poster.png)
  
 RNA-seq DRaMA does not allow the end user to perform initial differential expression analysis (DEA), but rather provides an interface to explore the analysis performed by a bioinformatician. Although implementing Shiny-based DEA is technically possible we decided not to provide this capability at a very early design stage.
 
 Three factors contributed to this decision: 
  ‚Ä¢ Computationally many aspects of creating the input for the platform are intractable for a typical user‚Äôs hardware (e.g.¬†pathway analysis). 
  ‚Ä¢ There is always a balance between accessibility and power, that is, a platform which could also perform DEA would inherently be more complex, and as a result, would be accessible to fewer users (especially to high-level decision-makers that have limited time to learn the technical nuances of DEA). From the very beginning we hoped to create a platform with a shallow learning curve. 
  ‚Ä¢ It is almost impossible to foresee specific experimental designs or the need for an unusual model to account for a variety of experimental and nuisance variables. Experimental requirements often necessitate creating complex contrasts that cannot be easily automated. As such a platform with DEA would lack generality and would require constant tweaking in response to new, unique experimental requirements.
 
 The RNA-seq DRaMA app relies on R *Shiny*, *shinydashboard*, *plotly* and *ggplot2* packages to implement the framework for interactive data visualization. Several additional packages were used to support specific tasks. All methods for RNA-seq data exploration and visualization are accessible from links on the sidebar. Each method is extensively parameterized to customize analyses and graphic outputs. Internal clipboard functionality allows genes selection from one analysis to be used as input for a different method. Limited wildcard support allows gene selection based on patterns (eg. IL* will select all genes that start with ‚ÄúIL‚Äù). Plots generated by the app can be saved in pdf or png formats. The app is extensively documented: brief description of each plot/method is provided in-app in the description boxes, more detailed description of functionality is available via [Manual](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/index.html) at the sidebar. Currently, rnaseqDRaMA can be run as a local app in R environment or as a web application hosted on a shiny server or public services such as shinyapps.io. The app supports many methods for RNAseq data exploration, which we grouped into sections listed below: 
 
 [**Summary**](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/summary.html) - Provides a brief experiment summary including a link to sequencing quality control and statistics provided, effective number of reads for each sample, a table of samples and experimental variables, a gene-wise variance plot, and a P-value histogram.
 
 [**PCA**](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/pca.html) - Principal component analysis (PCA) and classic multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) of samples provides methods of reducing the number of variables describing your system to a few dimensions (called principal components, PC) that describe the largest sources of variation in your system. In RNA-seq, and other sequencing technologies, PCA is an efficient visualization tool for quickly identifying treatment effects on gene expression. It is also useful for diagnosing possible technical issues such as poor replicate reproducibility. PCA loadings heatmaps helps to determine principal component with largest contribution to a specific experimental variable 
 
 [**Correlation**](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/cor.html) - This section contains a sample correlation plot and gene coexpression heatmap to quickly identify outlying samples, visualize pairwise similarities between samples, and identify groups of genes whose expression changes in the same direction across all samples. R heatmaply package was used to create interactive heatmaps in rnaseqDRaMA.
 
 [**Set Intersections**](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/venn.html) - Venn Diagrams and their more exquisite counterpart, upset Plots, provide an overview of overlaps between differentially expressed genes in different treatment/condition combinations. This section relies on several extensively modified functions from the *VennDiagram* package and *UpSetR* package
 
 [**Heatmap**](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/geneheat.html) - The Highly Variable Gene Heatmap is useful for identification of genes which are strongly altered across samples/conditions. In addition if a large enough number of samples are collected, heatmaps can inform the presence of outliers and genes which are most important for the observed effect of a treatment. The Custom Gene Selection Heatmap accepts gene names from a user and plots their expression changes across conditions (logCPMs) or comparisons (logFC). Combined with sets of genes from Set Intersections, custom heatmaps will give additional insight into how gene regulation is changing between conditions.
 
 [**Gene Expression**](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/geneexpr.html) - This section provides access to the table of raw and normalized read counts for each expressed gene identified in the experiment and creates customized bar graphs for user selected gene sets. 
 
 [**Differential Expression**](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/volcano.html) - Visualizes the results of differential expression analysis in the form of a volcano plot with several levels of gene selection. A Volcano Plot combines a measure of statistical significance (P-Value or FDR) with the magnitude of the change between compared samples. 
 
 [**Pathway Analysis**](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/qusage.html) - Visualizes the results of QuSAGE pathway analysis that reveals functionally-related sets of genes that are potentially co-regulated, and therefore may affect the outcome of an entire signaling or metabolic pathway. 
 
 [**TF Networks**](https://chinenovy.gitlab.io/drama_manual/tfnetwork.html) - Transcription Factor Networks section identifies transcription factors in a supplied set of genes and links them to their targets within the same set of genes producing a network graph representation. If only a single transcription factor gene is selected, a network of nearest neighbors of that TF will be shown. These networks are built based on AnimalTFDB 3.0 and RegNetwork which includes both transcription factors and transcriptional co-factors.",2020-03-20T06:00:29Z,

 # Introduction
 
 <img src ='https://github.com/jhk0530/shinyAssemble/raw/master/shinyAssemble.png' width = '120' align = 'right'></img>
 
 
 One of my favorite Guru, [Dean attali](https://github.com/daattali) mentioned that <br> it's really hard to decide `name` which is really important. <br>
 
 (if wrong meaning, sorry :frowning: ).
 
 But still, when I write codes in `shiny` I prefer to use very **rough** names.
 
 For example, <br>
 
 - `tab1` for `dataTableOutput`'s `outputId`.
 - `btn2` for `actionButton`'s `inputId`. 
 - `sld3` for `sliderInput`'s `inputId`.
 
 I agree with these terrible naming rule will lead me to very terrible situation sometime. but I wished it won't happen to me.
 
 Recently, I'm working with build shiny applications. and tons of variable names or ID swim in my head. 
 
 <img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6457691/76189058-083cd700-621d-11ea-979c-9079bd9d3693.png' width ='300'></img>
 
 To overcome this problem, I tried wrote names in `notepad`. but it was quite annoying and doesn't seem good. 
 
 So I built shiny application for visualize shiny applications module structure ( *instead of using sensible naming rule :slight_smile:* )
 
 ------
 
 # Contents
 
 My goal was quite simple. 
 
 1. I copy and paste code on `shiny`.
 2. `shiny` will read code and parse it to detect widgets like input, output.
 3. After widget detected, `shiny` visualize variable's name and their relation.
 4. Success

 # Methods
 
 ## to Visualize widgets as Network
 
 I used [`shinyCyJS`](https://github.com/jhk0530/shinyCyJS) which takes [`cytoscape.js`](https://js.cytoscape.org/) 's awesome features to `shiny`.
 
 `shinyCyJS` is network visualizing *engine* for shiny which I built myself for my research paper. 
 
 ## to design UI
 
 I used [`shinymaterial`](https://github.com/ericrayanderson/shinymaterial) which allows to use **material design concept** to design dashboard. 
 And for some additional features, I used customized functions from `shinymaterial`. you can see my efforts to customize.
 
 ## to group widgets as Module
 It was **hard challenge** to me to build `module` to wrapping connected widgets. Since there's no information about widgets before read code. So I have to build widgets first and then traverse widgets to get connected modules. which I failed to implement in R. so I choose detour with `javascript` with [`shinyjs`](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs).
 
 also I used [`colourpicker`](https://github.com/daattali/colourpicker), to make color selection. 
 
 *thanks again, Dean Attali*

 ### 3. assemble area
 
 Final result will show in here. shiny will return graph into cytoscape canvas, which gives a number of interaction features like move, pan, zoom, hover, select.
 
 One more, as I mentioned before, to generate module, user should use `module button`.

 You just need to press **dot (.)** on the keyboard in the request session and then write the answer secretly. When you press **dot** in the request text input everything you type will be masked, so you could put the answer without anyone noticing.
 
 Then, when you have finished typing the answer you just need to press dot again and complete the request phrase anyway you want.
 
 ## Example
 
 You tell a friend next to you that R can answer any question. To prove it you say you‚Äôre going to ask R the color of the shirt he‚Äôs wearing. In the request session you will write '.**red**.ase answer', but, only 'R please answer' will be shown on the screen. In the next step you will write the following question: 'What is the color of the t-shirt of the person next to me?'.

 # Introduction
 
 Thanks to AlphaGo and Sedol Lee, There's strongly increased demand for learn how to program in the era of big data. <br>
 
 And with many contribution by many awesome people, It's fine to say **you can easily learn how to write `R` code**. Because, there're many and many free resources that you can study.
 
 In many learning curriculum both on-line and off-line, they explain technical things like **How to use `for`**. <br>
 
 But they don't mention coding style like **You should assign with `<-` instead of `=`.** <br>
 
 I think it's really important issue for every developer, unless he (or she) wants to work without any communication with other.
 
 [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) organized and well explained about this, but I think newbee can not arrive to that document. <br>
 
 So I built this shiny application. with interesting topic that I didn't used before, `learnr` and `rmarkdown`. <br>
 For myself and people who want to learn (not read) well defined coding style.
 
 ------
 
 # Contents
 
 `learnTidy` is built based on [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) <br>
 
 <img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6457691/77423987-bb0f5680-6e13-11ea-84aa-5d3312eacb3d.png'></img>
 
 Here are topics I implemented in `learnTidy`.
 
 * Files
 * Syntax
 * Functions
 * Pipes
 * ggplot2
 
 which can be restart always

 # Methods
 
 ## to Generate interactive tutorial 
 
 I use `learnr` and also `rmarkdown`. 
 
 ## to build Exercise or Quiz
 
 since style guide needs example with `long codes`
 it was complex to build proper problems.
 
 so I choosed to assign code as `correct` or `wrong` in fixing problem. to see their result with `run code`
 
 <img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6457691/77423750-3de3e180-6e13-11ea-85c0-db587f3e024d.gif' width = '600'></img>
 
 and for code multiple line needed that hard to fix, I built selection problems.
 
 <img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6457691/77423753-3fada500-6e13-11ea-90c3-dd35a452fe54.gif' width = '600'></img>
 
 ## to design UI
 
 Again, It was **hard challenge** to me to customize my tutorial.
 because `learnr`'s manuscript wasn't helpful for me. 
  
 This is all it explained, even any examples.
 
 <img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6457691/77422283-8a79ed80-6e10-11ea-8375-d520eecaa54f.png' width = '600'></img>
 
 <img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6457691/77422684-39b6c480-6e11-11ea-8f40-bbc97c96ccb1.png' width = '600'></img>
 
 - So I collected tutorial format. <br>
 - and built - customized for myself<br>
 - That includes modify `htm` and `pandoc`, `css` file <br>
 - and export customized `rmarkdown` output format with customized package.
 - Actually, I used emoji with `emo` package, but it suddenly not worked. 
 
 <img src ='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6457691/77422778-65d24580-6e11-11ea-9fe8-9aa4b09cbcd9.jpg' width = '500'></img>
 
 ## to deploy on shinyapps.
 
 This was 2nd `hard challenge` for me, to achieve this I surfed tons of issue, Q&A, documents. 
 because, `learnTidy` uses custom `rmarkdown` format as rendering output, which is built on custom package `learnTidy`.
 
 but to use `learnTidy`, that custom package needs to be installed. How awful dillema. It worked very well on my local machine. <br>
 And to deploy `learnTidy` on `shinyapps.io` I used almost entire last weekend to handle package dependency problem.<br>
 Anyway, `packrat` wasn't helpful.<br>
 
 ------
 
 ## Note
 
 - Example quiz, and exercise is poor I think. 
 - :sweat: `learnTidy` doesn't work properly on `RStudio Cloud project`. I'm not sure, but I think it's related with package dependency maybe.",2020-03-24T12:14:35Z,

It quantitatively synthesises evidence from the comparison network of all relevant trials. Statistical complexity limited researchers who used it primarily to statistical experts. MetaInsight removes this restriction by conducting NMA using an accessible ‚Äòpoint and click‚Äô interface whilst leveraging established analysis routines, with the aim to improve healthcare decision making.","Network meta-analysis (NMA) has been increasingly adopted in evidence-based medicine to compare multiple interventions since it addresses the crucial question ‚Äòwhich intervention is the ‚Äòbest‚Äô?‚Äô for a given condition. NMA requires specialised statistical modelling making accessibility problematic for non- statisticians. This in turn means that systematic reviews conducted by those without the skills to conduct NMA inevitably synthesise the trials of each intervention separately (using standard meta-analysis techniques) producing results that cannot identify the ‚Äòbest‚Äô treatment among them. 
 
 MetaInsight is a tool that conducts NMA via the web requiring no specialist software for the user to install but leveraging established analysis routines (specifically, but not exclusively, the netmeta and gemtc packages in R). The tool is interactive and uses an accessible ‚Äòpoint and click‚Äô interface and presents results in visually intuitive and appealing ways for immediate download.
 
 As well as carrying out analyses, data and results are presented graphically, and exploration of the robustness of the results is encouraged by the ability to explore the impact of excluding specific studies in the evidence base directly within the interface. As is the checking of the modelling assumptions via a consistency of evidence assessment.

MetaInsight removes this restriction by conducting NMA using an accessible ‚Äòpoint and click‚Äô interface whilst leveraging established analysis routines, with the aim to improve healthcare decision making.","Network meta-analysis (NMA) has been increasingly adopted in evidence-based medicine to compare multiple interventions since it addresses the crucial question ‚Äòwhich intervention is the ‚Äòbest‚Äô?‚Äô for a given condition. NMA requires specialised statistical modelling making accessibility problematic for non- statisticians. This in turn means that systematic reviews conducted by those without the skills to conduct NMA inevitably synthesise the trials of each intervention separately (using standard meta-analysis techniques) producing results that cannot identify the ‚Äòbest‚Äô treatment among them. 
 
 MetaInsight is a tool that conducts NMA via the web requiring no specialist software for the user to install but leveraging established analysis routines (specifically, but not exclusively, the netmeta and gemtc packages in R). The tool is interactive and uses an accessible ‚Äòpoint and click‚Äô interface and presents results in visually intuitive and appealing ways for immediate download.
 
 As well as carrying out analyses, data and results are presented graphically, and exploration of the robustness of the results is encouraged by the ability to explore the impact of excluding specific studies in the evidence base directly within the interface. As is the checking of the modelling assumptions via a consistency of evidence assessment.

Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson also gain regular employment from the Wes Anderson film factory. Who else has appeared in multiple films? Has his list of regulars changed over time? Explore these questions, and more, with this interactive, pastel-coloured, Futura-fonted, shiny app!","Sure, ggplot2 is pretty sweet, and dplyr has its uses, but I think we can all agree that the most vital package in the R universe is the {wesanderson} package by Karthik Ram. 
 
 For those that don't know, the {wesanderson} package collates an array of colour palettes inspired by the films of, well, Wes Anderson. Giving your data visualisations that pastel-coloured, twee, achingly-hip look you've been craving has never been so easy! I thought, what better way to utilise this package than with a visualisation of the films of, well, Wes Anderson.
 
 This project started out as a static network visualisation. You can read about this first iteration on my blog: [https://davidsmale.netlify.com/portfolio/wes-anderson-actor-network/](https://davidsmale.netlify.com/portfolio/wes-anderson-actor-network/). I couldn't resist returning to this project to turn it into an interactive network after discovering the package {visNetwork} (whilst making my shiny app for last year's shiny contest!)
 
 So here it is, an interactive network visualisation of all credited actors to have appeared in Wes Anderson's 9 feature-length films to date. 
 
 The list of actors and films was scraped from IMDb using the {rvest} package. The network data was created using the {tidygraph} package by [Thomas Pedersen](https://twitter.com/thomasp85), which was then passed to the magic of {visNetwork} to make an interactive visualisation. {shiny} was then used to add some inputs for more interactivity.
 
 In an attempt to repeat the success of my submission to last year's contest ([https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/magnetic-fields.html](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/magnetic-fields.html)), I have once again designed the app to be aesthetically-aligned to the subject matter (I am a one-trick pony). Obviously, the colours are taken from scenes in his films (via the {wesanderson}) package. Each film node is coloured by a colour taken from that film's colour palette. The font used is Futura, because [Wes Anderson Loves Futura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4fY3oIHdNc). The app is designed to be symmetrical, with a column on the left and right, and the title centred, because Wes also loves symmetry. Why not dramatically zoom into the network too, for added Wes-ness.
 
 Although this app is made up of just one page, I spent an inordinate amount of time getting it just so. The node positions themselves have been partially manually placed, by taking the default positions (based on random seed) and then taking their coordinates out of shiny (using the visGetPositions function) to then tweak some of the node positions. The things you do for love. Also, CSS was used to alter the shiny inputs of the slider bar and input boxes. Wes is also a stickler for the details after all. As Max Fischer in Rushmore says:
 
 > ""I guess you‚Äôve just gotta find something you love to do and then‚Ä¶ do it for the rest of your life.""
 
 Thanks for reading, and remember, please use Wes Anderson colour palettes responsibly.

A few weeks ago, as part of a project at work, I created a filter module that filters a data set based on several conditions. Since then I thought about extending the functionality to other dplyr functions. The result is this app which supports most of the dplyr functions and allows to create plots with ggplot2.
 
 **Transformation Table**
 
 The heart of the app is the Transformation Table. It allows to apply different operations to a data set. The data set is piped from one operation to the next, i.e. the output of the first operation is the input of the second operation and so on.
 
 **Dataset Explorer**
 
 The app provides all data.frames/tibbles from the packages datasets, dplyr and ggplot2. Custom datasets can be uploaded in csv or rds format. The data selection is done via the dataset explorer. Datasets can be stored, renamed or removed in an arbitrarily nested folder structure. A datatable is used for visualization.
 
 **Help Pages**
 
 To make the app easier to use, I have added a help system inspired by the R Help. The individual topics are linked to each other. An overview of all topics can be found in the index. Additionally there is a Getting Started Guide.
 
 **Feedback**
 
 I am happy to receive feedback of any kind. I decided to take part in the contest less than two weeks ago and since then I have been working exclusively on the app. I have tried to catch as many bugs as possible, but certainly missed some.

 The World Development Indicators are a compilation of relevant, high-quality, and internationally comparable statistics compiled by the World Bank from officially recognized international sources. The database contains 1,600 time series indicators for 217 economies and more than 40 country groups, with data for many indicators going back more than 50 years.
 
 While the WDI web site provides some basic map visualization, the WDI_map_app extends the visual appeal of the maps by offering a simplified procedure to extract the indicator and representing the data on a choropleth map with a lot of additional options. Therefore, the main purpose of the app is to serve as a one-stop shop for visualizing the vast array of the World Development Indicators using a *choropleth map*.
 
 The app features:
 * One universal tool for all indicators regardless their type
 * Interdependent filtering by topic, up to 2 subtopics and year
 * Automatic filtering out the years without any data
 * Extensive palette color selection between sequential and diverging color sets
 * Palette type selection between continuous, improved bins (with a proprietary algorithm) and quantile ones
 * Map type selection between regular and scaled (normalized cartogram-like)

This makes them not only harder to access for beginners, and generally complicates browsing analysis results in a human-friendly way. To address this problem in the field of Metabolomics (the study of small molecules), I wrote Metaboseek as a way to access the most popular computational workflows in our lab, most notably the [`xcms`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html) package. It first started as a simple R console script to inspect chromatographic peaks, but then grew into a shiny app with more and more functionality - this progression may sound familiar to many of you :)!","## Some background
 
 In Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS), so called mass spectra are acquired in rapid succession. Each spectrum can contain the mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) of thousands of charged molecules (ions) and their intensity (=relative abundance) at one time point. The molecules are separated through chromatography before entering the mass spectrometer, so that ions are separated in an additional dimension, the retention time (rt). This is particularly important to get separate signals for molecules with the same or very similar m/z value, but different structures (this happens a lot). 
 
 The combination of m/z value and retention time can be defined as a `molecular feature`. Although these `molecular features` typically don't allow unambigous identification of specific compounds, their abundance can be compared between different biological samples. This can be very useful, because a molecular feature might be up- or downregulated in one sample group compared to another. For instance, some molecular features might only be found in a mutant strain of bacteria, but not in the wild-type control. In the approach to metabolomics presented here, we can select such molecular features of interest and then try to get more information about the molecular structure by tandem-MS, a method that breaks molecules into pieces and then reports the m/z of the resulting fragments.
 
 ## Features
 
 So what can you do with this app? I would like to highlight some of the things it can do, and invite you to check out the example data that is loaded in the online version (and is also included in the Metaboseek R package). Documentation on how to use the app is available at https://metaboseek.com/doc.
 
 Metaboseek offers a graphical user interface to set up data analysis with the `xcms` package to detect and align molecular features from LC/MS data across multiple samples. You can then load xcms results into the app as a ""Feature Table"" (using `xcms` and [`MSnbase`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSnbase.html) packages, [`mzR`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mzR.html)-based) and run statistical analyses to identify molecular features of interest.
 
 1. Filter the xcms results, view and export chromatograms and mass spectra for molecular features of interest.
 
 [Video/GIF]
 
 2. Generate and view molecular networks based on tandem-MS spectrum similarity between molecular features (using [`MassTools`](https://github.com/mjhelf/MassTools) and [`igraph`](https://github.com/igraph/rigraph) packages). The interactive plot is based on re-rendering plot.igraph() with different parameters depending on selections.

 3. Annotate fragments in tandem-MS spectra with [SIRIUS](https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/). Metaboseek sends jobs to the SIRIUS command line interface.

 ## Shiny Details
 
 Here are some of the a technical perspective, I would like to Metaboseek is strictly built from shiny modules,
 allowing for easy reuse and rearrangement of elements such as the spectral plots 
 
 * Metaboseek is an R package that contains the app code along with some data analysis functions
 
 * For improved code organization, Metaboseek is built from more than 70 different shiny modules, all of which are part of the Metaboseek package and documented. I am considering splitting grouping these modules into sub-packages for easier reuse by others.
 
 * a `reactivevalues` object called `values` is generated in the app, and is passed as an argument into the larger modules. Because elements in `reactivevalues` are mutable, changing them in one module has side effects that can be observed across the app. Some commonly accessed values are safely accessed by getter and setter functions (e.g. making sure the latest edits to the `Feature Table` are applied before getting its contents). This makes it easy to rearrange module hierarchy and makes the central data editable from all parts of the app. I would be happy to discuss this more and have some thoughts, e.g. [here](https://community.rstudio.com/t/s3-methods-custom-getters-and-setters-for-reactivevalues/31504/2).
 
 * You can use your arrow keys to browse through the `Feature Table` and switch between plots (for spectra and chromatograms) very quickly. To make this run smoothly, I had to make some compromises. For plotting, I use base-R plots. `ggplot` (and `plotly`) take longer to build the plot when the plotting data is changed, and browsing the Feature Table would be slow. In addition, the plotted data is drawn from the LC/MS data that is loaded into the session, and currently that means it is in memory and accessed through (deprecated) `xcms` functions which work faster than the current functions in this use case (getting a small amount of data from many files at a time).
 
 * The central object of class `MseekFT` contains the `Feature Table` along with its processing history. It can be saved from the UI (using `saveRDS()` internally) so that upon reloading the data, all previous steps are on record. The processing history can also be viewed in the app. All `MseekFT` objects in a session can be saved (""Save session"") to facilitate sharing of information or resuming work. 
 
 * Data is generally loaded from and saved to the server side (and accessed with the [`shinyFiles`](https://github.com/thomasp85/shinyFiles) package). This avoids overhead from uploading the very large MS data files or, when running the app locally on a workstation, unnecessarily copying them.
 
 ## Deployment
 
 Unfortunately, I was not able to deploy the app on shinyapps.io. There seems to be a problem with installing [one of the required packages (`mzR`)](https://community.rstudio.com/t/http-599-time-out-error-while-deployapp-with-package-mzr/20644/16). However, there are other options to try the app:
 
 * Here is the [direct link](http://mosaic.bti.cornell.edu/Metaboseek/) to the app (with example data pre-loaded), hosted on a shiny-server instance at Boyce Thompson Institute/Cornell University (on this server, it takes up to a minute to load; when installed locally, it starts within a few seconds)
 
 * Take a look at the documentation [here](https://metaboseek.com/doc/) to see how to get Metaboseek as installer or .zip file for Windows (built using [R-portable](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rportable/)), as a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mjhelf/metaboseek) or from [GitHub](https://github.com/mjhelf/Metaboseek).

 HospRep is an application for a monthly overview over the performance of the complete hospital (Vulpius Klinik) and their different departments. From 2017, the shiny app replaced the outdated Excel-based sheets. Before 2017 preparation of the report wasted many days. Now after export of the data, preparing and deploying takes about 10 minutes. 
 
 ### Prerequisites for using HospRep
 I built HospRep in R, an open source programming language using the Shiny package, a web application framework for R. All required code is in this github repository.
 
 ### Data
 I stored the required data in two lists, y_prev and y_akt, each list containing the data for a specific period, y_prev (2018-2019), y_akt (2019-2020). The data are an export of our hospital EHR (electronic health records). Pre-processing with R removes patients identification and build tables and data summaries to enhance the performance of the shiny app. 
 
 ### Running app and repo
 The application is published on: 
 https://kphahn.shinyapps.io/hosprep/. 
 Github repo: https://github.com/phahn57/hosprep
 RStudio cloud: https://rstudio.cloud/project/976360
 
 ### Privacy
 HospRep works with sensitive patients data. During pre-processing, all patient identification are removed. For the running example, the original data are modified and do not reflect the real hospital.

 In addition, the script used to graph the qHTS data, before becoming an application, has allowed our team to graph 3-dimensional qHTS data for various assays in a simple and time-efficient manner. Before creating this application, we used various software to graph the 3D qHTS data. While they were able to accomplish the task, they were not user friendly and incredibly time consuming. 
 Two of the main purposes of developing this application were 1) to reduce the data graphing processing time and 2) to create a user-friendly application for biologists, chemists, informaticians, and the general public to create 3D qHTS graphs. Creating a user-friendly application for everyone could encourage research reproducibility because a lot of the data from qHTS assays are available on PubChem.

 This [Shiny App](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an interactive graph and displays the trajectories of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the German federal states. The number of new confirmed cases in the past week is plotted against the total number of confirmed cases. Both axes are scaled logarithmically in order to be able to resolve the development at the beginning of the spread.
 
 This method of plotting reveals exponential growth as a straight line with a positive slope. All German states follow a very similar straight line from a total number of confirmed cases of about 100. The growth rate of exponential propagation is then comparably large in all federal states.
 
 The adoption of measures for social distancing should initially be shown by the flattening of the slope and finally by a downward trajectory. However, the delay in reporting should be kept in mind, which is particularly noticeable in the last one or two days of the trajectories.
 
 **Tips:**
 
 - States can be removed in the selection field after clicking with `<Del>` and can be added again after clicking in the white area of the field.
 - The Play button at the right end of the reporting date slider can be used to animate the entire development.
 - When the slider is selected, the arrow buttons can be used to jump back and forth by individual days.

 **Original German description of the app:**
 
 Diese [Shiny App](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) ist ein interaktiver Graph und stellt die Trajektorien best√§tigter COVID-19-F√§lle in den deutschen Bundesl√§ndern dar. Die Anzahl der neuen best√§tigten F√§lle in der vergangenen Woche wird gegen die Gesamtzahl best√§tigter F√§lle aufgetragen. Beide Achsen sind dabei logarithmisch skaliert, um auch die Entwicklung am Beginn der Ausbreitung aufl√∂sen zu k√∂nnen.
 
 Bei dieser Art der Auftragung offenbart sich exponentielles Wachstum als Gerade mit positiver Steigung. Alle Bundesl√§nder folgen dabei ab einer Gesamtzahl best√§tigter F√§lle von etwa 100 einer sehr √§hnlichen Gerade. Die Wachstumsrate der exponentiellen Ausbreitung ist dann in allen Bundesl√§ndern vergleichbar gro√ü.
 
 Das Greifen von Ma√ünahmen zum Social Distancing sollte sich zun√§chst durch das Abflachen der Steigung und schlie√ülich durch ein Abknicken der Trajektorie nach unten zeigen. Allerdings sollte hierbei der Meldeverzug im Hinterkopf behalten werden, der sich besonders in den letzten ein bis zwei Tagen der Trajektorien niederschl√§gt.
 
 **Tipps:** 
 
 - Bundesl√§nder lassen sich im Auswahlfeld nach Anklicken mit `<Del>` entfernen und nach Klicken in den wei√üen Bereich des Feldes auch wieder hinzuf√ºgen.
 - Mit dem Play Button am rechten Ende des Schiebereglers f√ºr das Meldedatum kann die gesamte Entwicklung animiert werden.
 - Wenn der Schieberegler ausgew√§hlt ist, kann mit den Pfeiltasten um einzelne Tage vor- und zur√ºckgesprungen werden.

This tool evaluate important parameters of the absorption bands of the NPs. Specifically, it provides their maximum optical absorbance, Surface Plasmon Resonance peak (SPR) and Full Width at Half maximum (FWHM).These parameters are closely related to the diameter, shape, and polydispersity of metal and semiconductor NPs. Therefore, this application can be used to monitor the nano-manufacturing of NPs, to understand its stability under different conditions and mediums, to establish their optical properties, among others studies which use spectrochemical analysis (UV-VIS) as technique to characterize NPs.","Engineered nanoparticles (NPs) are being used for a broad array of high-technology applications, including sensing, imaging, targeted drug delivery, biodiagnostics, catalysis, optoelectronics, and film growth seeding. The enhanced optical, electrical, and catalytic properties of metal NPs are strongly correlated with their size, shape, and structure. As such, physicochemical characterization of NPs is critically important to ensure their effective use and applicability.
 
 In this context, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-VIS) is one of the most widely used methods for measuring the optical properties and electronic structures of NPs. UV-VIS absorption bands are related to important properties such as the diameter, shape, and polydispersion of metallic and semiconductor NPs. Thus, this analytical technique is used during NP synthesis to monitor NP formation, to assess suspension stability under different conditions and media, and to establish the optical properties of the newly formed nanomaterials.
 
 In view of the extensive use of UV-VIS for NP characterization and monitoring of NP formation during synthesis reactions, we developed NanoUV-VIS, an interactive web application designed for the analysis of multiple UV-VIS absorbance spectra measured as a function of time. Graphical visualizations of the data in two dimensions (spectrum plot, contourplot) and three dimensions (surface plot) are created by this tool. In addition, the NanoUV-VIS tool evaluates and estimates important parameters related to the absorption bands of NPs, including maximum optical absorbance, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak, and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the UV-VIS spectra. This information is available to download as a table in the software, as well as in the form of interactive plots, where the scientist can compare the behavior of these parameters in order to better interpret the outcomes of the experiment.
 
 Though NanoUV-VIS was designed to visualize NP synthesis, this tool can be used for a wide range of other applications in nanotechnology and nanoscience, such as the assessment of suspension stability, the investigation of the influence of coating agents on the NP optical properties, and the monitoring of seedmediated NP synthesis, among others. Moreover, this data analysis and visualization tool can be extended to other fields beyond nanotechnology in which spectrochemical analysis by UV-VIS plays an important role.",2020-04-03T20:46:23Z,"standard shiny aesthetic, some nice plotly visualizations "

It provides over 20 different analysis methods with user-friendly GUI. Recently, 6 main categories of analytic modules (Diversity, Descriptive, Oridination, Correlation, Clustering and Non-parametric test) are included","Can I do this easily?
 
 The principle of GenePiper is simple - Make our life easier.
 
 NGS data mining involves many packages, many tools, many commands and many different data format. We need to switch between different data format, transform data tables with different tools to fit the data into different analytical test packages. The routine data transformation work usually take up more than half of the data analysis time.
 
 GenePiper is designed to take care of all these routine and tedious tasks. The data is imported once and saved. GenePiper will handle all the process from converting the raw data to getting the result from different analysis. User can easily subset their data and save for future use or subset data ad hoc for each analysis.
 
 The GUI of GenePiper is based on R Shiny package which seamlessly connects the interactive interface to the data analysis process. GenePiper provides different parameters for user to fine tune the analysis and test different grouping setting.
 
 xxxx:error exit status 1?
 
 NGS data mining involves many packages and tools. The installation of all these packages sometimes causes more trouble than using them. New package may conflict with the existing one. Installation may fail because of missing library. Package version may not be compatible.
 
 To address the above problem, GenePiper is built in a clean virtual environment via VirtualBox. The isolated environment provides consistency during installation. Through Vagrant, the installation of GenePiper becomes easier using only one command.
 
 Did our data safe?
 
 Most NGS data being analysed are unpublished data. The security of data are also the main concern when using cloud apps provided by others. So, GenePiper installed in the virtual environment on user's own computer can address this problem and ensure the data security.

Leagues page contains descriptive statistics, visuals and comparisions about each leagues. Also it shows the best 11 players in terms of tactics.
 
 Teams page gives some useful insights from all of teams. 
 ‚Ä¢ Summary tab shows us to learn talent distribution based on variables and position classes. 
 ‚Ä¢ Value tab visualize value of the team.
 ‚Ä¢ Best Players tab helps to find the suitable tactics for the team.

 ‚Ä¢ Set Piece Goal tab tells us to find relevant players for free kicks and penalties. 
 ‚Ä¢ BMI tab reports and visualize BMI (Body Mass Index).
 
 Players page is one of the important page in this dashboard. It helps to compare two players. There are some descriptive statistics and visuals. Also it finds similar players using distance measurements.

 ‚Ä¢ Similarity tab discovers similar players using distance measurements. There are many different methods such as Eucledian, Maximum, Manhattan, Canberra, Minkowski, Pearson, Spearman and Kendall. Max three leagues can be entered for analysis.
 
 Another important page is Scout page. Scouting is very important for Clubs. That's why, I tried to use some statistical methods to discover talented players. I also designed a surprise page with gamification. You can create a team and also transfer and sell players.
 ‚Ä¢ There is a player database. You will be able to find players using the database. 
 ‚Ä¢ Best players tab shows top ten players from each position class.
 ‚Ä¢ Player Stats tab contains SWOT Analysis, Player Data, Visuals, Hierarchical Clustering and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). In order to find the possible position of the player LDA algorithm was used.
 ‚Ä¢ Player Clustering tab enabes to apply K-NN algorithm. K-NN works for each position class and finds the clusters. I tried different k parametres such as 2,3,4 and 5. I chose optimal k value for clustering and I found k=4 as optimal k value. After the analysis, there are visuals, K-NN results and player clusters.
 ‚Ä¢ PCA tab contains a multivariate statistical analysis. PCA means Principle Component Analysis. PCA gives a score to compare the observations. I used to compare players and teams each position class. I used to compare players and teams each position class with PCA Score. Bar graphs show us the best players by using PCA Score and Overall variable.
 ‚Ä¢ Correlation tab helps to find relationship two variables. I did correlation tests like Pearson, Spearman and Kendall methods and ploted the results. Also I added a hypothesis test. Unpaired Two-Samples Wilcoxon Test investigates whether there is a significant difference between the two groups.

 The app fulfills three main goals: 
 
 **1. Analyze the shooting pattern of any NBA player**
 Players tend to shot from many positions, but they usually have higher scoring percentages in some positions. Would be great to know from where a specific player usually shoots and from where does this player have a better scoring percentage?
 
 In this first tab you will be able to analyze exactly that for any player of the 2018-2019 NBA season. 
 
 Simply pick a player and the shot type you want to analyze (all shot types is not allowed due to lack of memory of shinyapps free server). The app will automatically do the math and plot two field-heatmaps. By the way, the fields are done with ggplot2 ;)
 
 Besides, I have created a pollar chart that enables you to compare that exact player with the global scoring average of the nba for that shot type and season. 
 
 I have also added the raw numbers (amount of shots thrown and scoring percentage) so that we can have a clear idea of the data. 
 
 **2. Compare the shooting scoring percentage of two players**
 
 There are many players on the NBA but, which one is better? In this case, I have created a comparison ""game"" between players.
 
 The methodology is pretty straightforward: just pick two players. The app will automatically calculate the shooting scoring percentage for both players and compare them. 
 
 The winner will be shown in the middle of the app with some confetti animation (this is done with some JavaScript, which you will also find on the repo). 
 
 Besides, the app automatically scraps and shows the photo, jersey number and team logo for each player and the winning player. 
 
 **3. Kobe Bryant tribute**
 Kobe Bryant was a legend and it wouldn't be fair to do an app without honoring him on the app.
 
 To do so, I have shown the average scoring points per game for each of the seasons he played, together with the minutes and scoring data for each match.
 
 I have also worked out the two major accomplishments of Kobe for each year and in general, so you that for each year you choose you will learn what he did. 
 
 Finally, I have wanted to make this tab a little bit special. That is why, when you enter here, all the style of the app changes: an image is set as background, colors and styles are changed... I have tryed to make Kobe's tab special as he was for many of us.

 Final notes.
 
 -The app has a large CSS ""developing"" behind. It not only imitates material design but it is also responsive. I am not an expert on CSS so probably there are many mistakes and things to improve, but I does the trick.

 The app is developed with the intention of eliminating a common problem by using the taxi service in the Metropolitan Area of Pachuca City (Hidalgo State, Mexico). This problem (among many others) is the unjustified high price for the service, although we know that there is a fee established by the Ministry of Mobility and Transportation of Hidalgo, the operators of the units rarely respect it, which generally increases the cost of the transfer or, in some cases, users don't want to pay the right cost for the journey that they have made.
 
 A posible solution
 This project use R packages like Shiny, OSRM, Leaflet and others, to get the approximate cost of a trip according to the starting point and destination point based on the rate approved by the Conventional Transportation System of Hidalgo with the intention of avoiding any problematic situation between the user and the service provider.
 
 In the future
 The objectives that it seeks to fulfill, either directly or indirectly, are issues such as the fair cost for the taxi service, improving the service by avoiding any type of confrontation due to disagreements with the payment, encouraging greater use of taxis since it generally decreases the cost in short journeys also, which is projected in a more advanced phase of the application, to be able to share through the interface the real-time location, information about the driver and personalized request of the service that minimizes the losses for the operator.

Drill hole databases are an essential component for geological and economic modeling of the earth‚Äôs natural resources. Each drill hole in a database is defined by attributes in 3D space. They will have a beginning point with X, Y and Z coordinates and a direction recorded from downhole survey measurements that measure the direction (azimuth) and angle from the surface (dip). All drill holes in a database should be subjected to a quality control process to ensure spatial validity. Failure to implement this process could result in spatially inaccurate drill hole locations, drill directions, and a risk of losing time and money to fix issues. The easiest and quickest spatial validation method is visual, viewing drill hole traces through various sectional directions or in 3D. This shiny app can be used as a first pass spatial validation of drill holes in a database before being exposed or extracted for other applications. The app connects to one type of drill hole database hosted in Azure. Several spatial transformations are applied, and minimum curvature calculation is used to de-survey (calculate X, Y and Z coordinates) each drill hole ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù to produce a plottable drill hole traces. Among others the app makes use of the libraries:
 
 * shinydashboard
 
 * leaflet - to view drill hole locations on a map and filter selections
 
 * ggplot2 - to view drill hole traces in plan and sectional views
 
 * plotly - to view drill hole traces in a 3D plot.

 How was this built?
 R and Shiny. Source code can be found here!
 
 What is the data source?
 We use Google Sheets as a data source and the R package googlesheets4 to read in the data. Raw data can be found here. 
 
 Additional Info
 - The paired Wilcox test is used for the ""Same Taste?"" statistic
 - The twitter image URLs are harvested each time the dashboard loads to avoid the issue of URLs changing with avatar updates
 - All flavor types are hotlinks (minus the plots) to the flavor on GFuels website
 - This dashboard needs no updates, aside from UI additions, only the data source needs to be updated. The data, profiles, plots, and tables are made directly from the google sheet
 
 Learning Points
 - Packages: googlesheets4 and shinydashboardplus
 - Setting up a google sheet as a data source for a Shiny app

 NanoString nCounter data is a messenger-RNA/micro-RNA (mRNA/miRNA) expression assay and works with fluorescent barcodes.
 Each barcode is assigned a mRNA/miRNA, which can be counted after bonding with its target.
 As a result each count of a specific barcode represents the presence of its target mRNA/miRNA.
 
 NACHO is able to load, visualise and normalise the exported NanoString nCounter data and facilitates the user in performing a quality control.
 NACHO does this by visualising quality control metrics, expression of control genes, principal components and sample specific size factors in an interactive web application.

FreeClust is an open source web-app for easy **interactive clustering** and cluster validation. Choose from several algorithms, play with parameters, plot results in a fully interactive fashion, and download publish-ready plots.
 
 The web-app integrates several clustering algorithms:
 
 * a widely-used hierarchical clustering (based on R's `hclust`) with a choice of commonly used linkage methods to construct the tree diagram (dendrogram),
 
 * sparse hierarchical clustering (using R's package `sparcl`), tailored to cluster high-dimensional data (with many more variables than samples). The sparse hierarchical clustering provides information about the **importance** of features/measurements across the samples.
 
 Clustering will partition data even if it does not contain any clusters! Therefore, it is important to assess clustering tendency before the analysis, and **validate** the quality of the result after clustering. A separate module addresses this very issue. It contains cluster validation methods that allow to estimate the optimal number of clusters or assess the quality of existing clustering by inspecting the plot of principal component analysis, the silhouette plot, and he dendrogram.
 
 FreeClust accepts CSV files in a wide format and allows for rudimentary data manipulation, such as rescaling, removal of missing data, trimming/clipping outliers. Several datasets are available within the app for testing.",2020-03-19T21:56:09Z,no sample data

 Please see the open access publication for implementation details and methodology. A detailed introduction to DiscoRhythm can be found in the package [vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DiscoRhythm/inst/doc/disco_workflow_vignette.html). Some noteworthy features of DiscoRhythm are highlighted below.
 
 **Quality Control**
 
 * Inter-sample Correlations - Provides an interactive heatmap with hierarchical clustering of pairwise sample correlations ([heatmaply](https://github.com/talgalili/heatmaply)) to visually identify outliers and sample clusters.
 
 * Principal component analysis (PCA) - Allows recomputation of PCs after removing outliers and includes panels for outlier identification, interactive PC score scatterplots, a standard scree plot, and an exhaustive set of pairwise scatterplots to view the relationships between many PCs.
 
 * Filtering summary - Multiple controls to conveniently remove samples based on the two outlier identification steps, updating the displayed sample key table. The table may also be directly interacted with to remove or add specific samples.
 
 * Row Selection - Enables two fast row-wise ANOVA tests ([matrixTests](https://github.com/KKPMW/matrixTests)) to detect high signal rows and provides multiple methods to merge replicates including random selection, allowing the user to have control over the random seed for reproducible random selections.
 
 * A status summary table in the application sidebar allows users to easily see the current methodology being applied, with the number of samples and features remaining in the dataset.
 
 * Panels are included in relevant sections to view the current state of the data matrix.
 
 **Oscillation Detection**
 
 * The job submission interface dynamically responds to the dataset structure to provide access to valid methods and runtime estimations. Multiple methods can be run and compared in a single submission.
 
 * The ‚ÄòIndividual models‚Äô section, in addition to simple sorting, searching, and viewing of individual features, allows for filtering of features by rhythmic parameters. These filters can be applied to the summary plots to explore different subsets.
 
 * The session can be output as a zip archive by applying the active session‚Äôs settings to recompute the entire workflow (this ensures future reproducibility). The comprehensive output with R code allows users to easily move from using the shiny application to using the DiscoRhythm R package directly.
 
 **General Features**
 
 * Statistical procedures are permitted to display their console message/warning/error text to the shiny application with `showNotification` or `showModal` to keep the user informed on the computation status.
 
 * In addition to CSS loaders in plot panels ([shinycssloaders](https://github.com/daattali/shinycssloaders)), a rotating wheel in the top left of the page indicates computations are in progress.
 
 * Downloadable figures and CSVs of results are available in each section.
 
 * Interactive plots ([plotly](https://plotly.com/r/)) throughout the application allow for sample identification.
 
 * Shiny/interactivity R packages in use: [shinyjs](https://deanattali.com/shinyjs/), [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/), [shinyBS](https://ebailey78.github.io/shinyBS/), [shinycssloaders](https://github.com/daattali/shinycssloaders), [heatmaply](https://github.com/talgalili/heatmaply), [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/), [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/), and of course, [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).",2020-03-27T15:08:51Z,not great UI but nicely done

 ## Introduction
 
 Have you ever visited [tidyverse page](https://www.tidyverse.org/)? 
 
 They displayed their R packages like collection of trophies.

 More than their awesome look, I strongly believe hexSticker of each package summarizes the basic and core concept of that package.
 
 Thanks to [GuangchuangYu](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu), there's `hexSticker` package to generate this hexSticker quite easily. 
 
 However, even it's not hard that much to create it, I usually made single use for each r packages, and forget to re-use it and build again and again.
 
 So I decided to create shiny package for easily and interactively customize hexstickers.
 
 ## Contents
 
 `polaroid` is built based on [hexSticker](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker) and [argonDashboard](https://github.com/RinteRface/argonDash)
 
 and all you have to do is just
 
 - upload png image for sticker.
 - set color / position / size of sticker attributes.
 - download sticker.

 This app started as a side-project that I used to learn Shiny, but quickly developed into something that I use every day for work. The app I use for work is only slightly modified to connect to our data warehouse, where I can select from pre-processed datasets or query the database. It allows me, as well as other people with no programming experience, to answer questions very quickly, without having to write code.
 
 This version of the app has the option to select from pre-loaded datasets (e.g. iris, flights, diamonds, and other popular datasets in R), upload an .RDS or .csv file, or load a dataset from a URL (.csv).
 
 The user has the ability to generate graphs, filter the dataset based on any variable, modify the dataset locally with R, look at high level summaries of the available variables and basic stats for each variable, save links to graphs they created, and more.
 
 As mentioned, the user can generate a link to any graph they created. The link has all information necessary (corresponding dataset, selected variables, filters, graph options) to rebuild the exact graph. This allows them to bookmark the graph for later, or share with others. For example, every Monday morning my colleagues and I use this app review KPIs for our team. The modified version I use for work (which is behind SSO authentication) has marketing/sales datasets that get updated nightly. We have a list of links that correspond to our KPIs, so it's as simple as clicking the link and latest data is loaded. We do have our KPIs in a general reporting system (e.g. Tableau), but when there are spikes/dips in trends, we often want to dive much deeper into the data to understand the source of the spike/dip, which can be much more difficult to do in a tool such as Tableau.",2020-03-28T19:12:26Z,interactive dataset explorer

This shiny app will take data from either a user file input or a selection of datasets from the MASS and ggplot2 libraries. 
 
 Data pre-processing includes reducing observations, removing missing values, imputing missing values, applying a function, scaling and rounding. Any number of numeric dimensions can be selected for dimension reduction and a class can be added to the data for visualization.
 
 UMAP and t-SNE algorithms can be run any number of times with varying parameters and either random or set seeds.
  
 KMeans clusters are generated and parameters can be varied. The clusterID‚Äôs are added to the input data which can be downloaded and used in classification models.
 
 Plots can be customized and downloaded.
 
 Possible reasons why charts are not working:
 
 * Selected dimensions are not numeric.
 
 * The selected dimensions contain a dimension that looks numeric but is not, an example is the diamonds dataset, the dimension ‚Äútable‚Äù is not numeric ‚Äì it can be used as a class.
 
 * Dataset contains missing values, an example is the biopsy dataset, see if you can work out which dimension contains missing values ‚Äì these can be removed in processing.

Deploy this application to your connect server to easily track usage on your server.,"# connectAnalytics
 
 The goal of `connectAnalytics` is to provide an out of the box shiny app that will allow for RStudio Connect users to see analytics information about their deployed applications and documents.
 
 ## Installation
 
 And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
 
 ```
 # install.packages(""devtools"")
 devtools::install_github(""tbradley1013/connectAnalytics"")
 ```
 
 ## Usage
 ### Prerequisites
 
 Before you can get started using the `connectAnalytics` dashboard for your organization, there are a few things that you need to do:
 
  1. Have access to an [RStudio Connect](https://rstudio.com/products/connect/) instance as either a [Publisher or Administrator](http://pwdrstudio.water.gov/rsconnect/__docs__/admin/user-management.html#user-roles)
  2. Configure the following environment variables:
  
  * `CONNECT_SERVER` - This variable should be the url of your connect server that you use to reach the base content page. **NOTE:** If your server's port is masked then you will need to add the actual port to the server URL
  * `CONNECT_API_KEY` - An API key generated from the Connect system. You can see how to generate an API key [here](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/api-keys.html)
  
  3. Install the `connectAnalytics` package as shown above
  
 ### Run the app
 
 To run the application, you can simply run the `connectAnalytics` wrapper function:
 
 ```r
 library(connectAnalytics)
 connectAnalytics()
 ```
 
 If you run it wittout specifying any arguments than it will automatically look for the two environment variables discussed above to connect to your RStudio Connect server. In addition, once the application connects to your server and loads you will see a modal pop up asking you to specify your connect username. By default, if a user is not specified than it looks for the `session$user` variable, if `session$user` is NULL (which it will be if running locally) than you will be asked for your username via the modal. It is designed like this because once deployed to your RStudio Connect system than whichever user access the application will see their usage information. See the deployment section below for more information. 
 
 There are several arguments that can be specified when running this app that can help the user customize the app to themselves or their organization:
 
  * `host` - If specified would override the `CONNECT_SERVER` environment variable
  * `api_key` - If specified would override the `CONNECT_API_KEY` environment variable
  * `user` - The RStudio Connect User name to run the application as
  * `switch_user` - `TRUE` or `FALSE`; Allows the user to specify different user names within the app to see usage information for other users. This feature could be userful for managers or supervisors who are not admins on the server but would like to be able to see how the content the people under them have deployed is being used. 
  * `favicon` - The path to a favicon icon to be used by your app. If `NULL` then the `golem` favicon is used (this may be changed in the future)
  * `title` - The title for your dashboard header. Defaults to `connectAnalytics`
  * `window_title` - The title to be displayed in the browser tab for your app. Defaults to the same value as the `title` argument
 
 
 
 ## Deployment
 
 If you want to deploy the application to your connect server so that publishers and admins can easily track their application usage data, you simply need to create an `app.R` file that looks like:
 
 ```r
 library(connectAnalytics)
 library(shiny)
 
 # Leave a commented out line of `shinyApp()` so that RStudio recognizes the script
 # as a shiny application!
 # shinyApp()
 
 connectAnalytics()
 ```
 
 This `app.R` file can then be published to your connect server in any way you would normally publish an application. It is recommneded that this application be deployed by an administrator with an API key for the admin account. This will allow all publishers and admins to easily view their usage data. If it is published by a user with `publiser` permissions than it will only be able to be used by that user due to API key restrictions. By default, API keys generated by an admin account are able to view usage for all users, while an API key associated with a publisher account can only see the data associated with their account. The application will parse through the content and only show publishers their data. If the user accessing the application is an admin, then an additional ""Admin"" tab will be created showing data for all users on the account.",2020-04-01T23:49:25Z,

Information from this application informs the management of environmental resources for the region under direction of the Tampa Bay Estuary Program.","Tampa Bay (Florida, USA) was designated an ""estuary of national significance"" by Congress in 1990, paving the way for development of a long-term blueprint for bay restoration through the Tampa Bay National Estuary Program (TBEP). TBEP coordinates the overall protection and restoration of the bay with assistance and support from its many formal and informal partners.
 
 Light availability to seagrass is the guiding paradigm for TBEP's Nitrogen Management Strategy. Because excessive nitrogen loads to the bay generally lead to increased algae blooms (higher chlorophyll-a levels) and reduce light penetration to seagrass, an evaluation method was developed to assess whether load reduction strategies are achieving desired water quality results (i.e. reduced chlorophyll-a concentrations and increased water clarity).
 
 This Shiny dashboard is a modern implementation of historical methods to report on water quality conditions in Tampa Bay. These methods synthesize a long-term monitoring dataset collected since 1975 to report on annual water quality conditions in the Bay. Year to year algae abundance (measured as chlorophyll-a concentrations) and visible light penetration through the water column (secchi disk depth visibility) have been identified as critical water quality indicators in Tampa Bay. Tracking the attainment of targets for these indicators provides the framework for developing and initiating bay management actions. 
 
 The different tabs on the dashboard can be used to view the long-term trends in water quality for each bay segment and individual monitoring stations. 
 
 1) __ATTAINMENT MATRICES__: This tab shows the overall report card for the bay as management action categories. Separate matrices for chlorophyll and light attenuation exceedances for major bay segments are also shown. An interactive map is provided that shows attainment outcomes by year for individual stations in the bay.
 
 1) __SEGMENT ANNUAL TRENDS__: This tab shows time series of annual chlorophyll and light attenuation averages for each bay segment. Blue lines on each plot show management targets or thresholds that define exceedance categories used to create the management action categories. In between the chlorophyll and light attenuation plots is the attainment matrix outcomes that are specific to each segment. The top row in the matrix shows the attainment outcome for chlorophyll, the bottom row shows the attainment outcome for light attenuation, and the middle row shows the overall management attainment outcome that combines information from both the chlorophyll and light attenuation outcomes. 
 1) __SEGMENT SEASONAL TRENDS__: This tab shows the seasonal distributions by bay segment for chlorophyll and light attenuation. Each boxplot shows the monthly distribution of observations across all available years in the dataset. The jittered points overlaid on the boxplots show the individual values for a specific year and the large red point shows the current year. Each observation can be clicked to view the observed phytoplankton cell counts for the selected year/month bay segment combination. 
 1) __SITE TRENDS__: This tab shows the time series for chlorophyll and light attenuation at individual stations (as compared to segment averages in the other tabs). Stations can be selected by clicking on the location in the map. Phytoplankton cell counts can also be viewed as quarterly sums across the period of record.",2020-04-02T15:41:49Z,

 The aim of the application is to develop a decision-support tool that simulates the dynamics of forest ecological processes.
 The application projects the most likely ecological succession in each stand based on the ecological context, and visualizes the relative importance of the different ecological mechanisms involved in the process. The resulting simulations help the manager to identify forest stands that most need intervention (active restoration), compared to other stands where intervention is unneeded (passive restoration), depending on the ecosystem services that the manager wishes to maximize. It also allows the user to visualize some of the complex ecological processes that underlie the diversification of pine plantations in Mediterranean mountain areas.
 This tool uses information published in scientific journals in a synthetic and straightforward way, enabling the manager to visualize different scenarios and perform simulations based on solid field data interpreted in scientific contexts",2020-04-03T10:01:50Z,Nice intro tour overlay

The driving philosophy is to provide a simple, yet flexible GUI to perform various time-series analyses without any programming knowledge. TCI is written as an R shiny web app which provides a reactive, fast and customizable framework to produce elegant visualizations. 
 
 The **screencast** with an overview of the app's functionality and processing of the [test-case-1](https://github.com/dmattek/shiny-timecourse-inspector/tree/master/example-data/test-case-1 ""Link to data"") dataset can be found [here](https://youtu.be/pwRqUzf5HMs ""Link to YouTube"").
 
 If you just wish to give the app a quick try without installing it, you can access a **running instance** at [shinyapps.io](https://macdobry.shinyapps.io/tcourse-inspector/ ""Link to a running app""). Bear in mind that your experience using this instance might be sluggish and that the number of uses per month is limited. For a quick trial, we rather recommend to run the app directly from GitHub as described in sections below.
 
 TCI has been applied for analysis of times series measurements of fluorescent biosensors and published [here](https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.20198947) and [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz846). However, the app can be used to analyse and cluster **any kind of time series data**!
 
 The starting point of the app is a plain spreadsheet in comma-separated values format (CSV) that contains the dataset to analyze. TCI embeds a module for simple preprocessing of the data (normalization, missing values handling...), various visualizations, common statistics report, spectral decomposition, a flexible module for hierarchical clustering and cluster validation. All modules are documented with tooltips and *Learn More* sections to guide users through the UI and assist them with the analysis.
 
 TCI aims to identify unique dynamic patterns present in a collection of univariate time-series. The resulting clusters can then be inspected to visualise the types of time series represented in each cluster. In addition, the distribution of clusters acroos the groups can be visualized to understand which dynamics or trends were over/under-represented in each group. The results of clustering are displayed as heatmaps with time series arranged in rows and time points shown in columns. The arrangement of clusters in the heatmap is illustrated by the dendrogram. The UI allows to *cut* the dendrogram at a desired level and to highlight major tree branches. This is useful to plot cluster averages and time series within such clusters in other tabs of that module.

You get cluster validation statistics and visualise cluster composition,"A shiny app to perform cluster analysis. 
 
 The app outputs cluster validation statistics and you can visualise the distribution of variables within the formed clusters.
 
 You can select variables to do the clustering, the clustering method and the number of clusters, and you get descriptives of various internal validation statistics.
 
 Once you have decided on the number of cluster and method, you can select variables to explore - visually and with tables - the distribution within the clusters. 
 
 The app is using the R packages: {cluster} for clustering, the {fpc} for internal validation statistics, uses the {tidyverse} collection of packages for data wrangling The graphs are produced with cthe {ggplot2} package. I also try to improve the UI using the {shinyWidgets} package (not there yet... :). 
 
 Lastly, I managed to incorporate some shiny modules functionality (not much yet, just the download buttons) to manage the code complexity.
 
 This is a work in progress, please send me your comments and suggestions on how to improve this app",2020-04-03T18:36:32Z,
