On May 19 and 20, 2016, Hadley Wickham will teach his two day Master R Developer Workshop in the centrally located European city of Amsterdam.

This is the first time we've offered Hadley's workshop in Europe. It's a rare chance to learn from Hadley in person. Only 3 public Master R Developer Workshop classes are offered per year and no future classes in Europe are planned at this time for 2016 or 2017.

If you don't want to miss this opportunity, [register now to secure your seat](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/master-r-developer-workshop-amsterdam-tickets-21345736673)!

For the convenience of those who may travel to the workshop, it will be held at the [Hotel NH Amsterdam Schiphol Airport](http://www.nh-hotels.com/events/en/event-detail/30729/rstudio_public_workshop.html).

We look forward to seeing you soon!
