Five months ago we launched [shinyapps.io](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shinyapps/). Since then, more than 25,000 accounts have been created and countless Shiny applications have been deployed. It's incredibly exciting to see!

It's also given us lots of data and feedback on how we can make [shinyapps.io](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shinyapps/) better. Today, we're happy to tell you about some changes to our subscription Plans that we hope will make [shinyapps.io](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shinyapps/) an even better experience for Shiny developers and their application users.

**New Starter Plan - More active hours and apps, less money**

For many people the price difference between the Free and the Basic plan was too much. We heard you. Effective today there is a new Starter Plan for only \$9 per month or \$100 per year. The Starter Plan has the same features as the Free plan but allows 100 active hours per month and up to 25 applications. It's perfect for the active Shiny developer on a budget!

**More Active Hours for Basic, Standard, and Professional Plans**

Once you're up and running with Shiny we want to make sure even the most prolific developers and popular applications have the active hours they need. Today we're doubling the number of active hours per month for the Basic (now 500), Standard (now 2,000), and Professional (now 10,000) plans. In practice, very few accounts exceeded the old limits for these plans but now you can be sure your needs are covered.

**New Performance Boost features for the Basic Plan**

In addition to supporting multiple R worker processes per application, which keeps your application responsive as more people use it, we've added more memory (up to 8GB) on Basic plans and above. While the data shows that most applications work fine without these enhancements, if you expect many users at the same time or your application is memory or CPU intensive, the Basic Plan has the performance boost you need. The Basic plan also allows unlimited applications and 500 active hours per month.
