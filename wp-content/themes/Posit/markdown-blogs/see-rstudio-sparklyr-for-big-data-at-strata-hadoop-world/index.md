If big data is your thing, you use R, and you're headed to Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose March 13 & 14th, you can experience in person how easy and practical it is to analyze big data with R and Spark.

In a beginner level talk by RStudio's Edgar Ruiz and an intermediate level  workshop by Win-Vector's John Mount, we cover the spectrum: What R is, what Spark is, how Sparklyr works, and what is required to set up and tune a Spark cluster. You'll also learn practical applications including: how to quickly set up a local Spark instance, store big data in Spark and then connect to the data with R, use R to apply machine-learning algorithms to big data stored in Spark, and filter and aggregate big data stored in Spark and then import the results into R for analysis and visualization.
