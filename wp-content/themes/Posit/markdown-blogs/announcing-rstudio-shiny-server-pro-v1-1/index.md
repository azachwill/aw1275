We are happy to announce the availability of v1.1 of [RStudio Shiny Server Pro](https://www.rstudio.com/shiny/server/), our commercial server for deploying [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) applications.  In this release we took your feedback and made it easier for you to integrate Shiny Server Pro into your production environments.  With Shiny Server Pro v1.1 you now can:

  * Control access to your applications with Google Authentication (OAuth2).

  * Create sessions and authenticate with PAM ([auth_pam](http://rstudio.github.io/shiny-server/latest/#pam-authentication) and [pam_sessions_profile](http://rstudio.github.io/shiny-server/latest/#pam-sessions)).

  * Set the version of R that is used per application and/or per user

  * Customize page templates for directory listings and error pages.

  * Monitor service health and get additional metrics with a new health check endpoint.

  * Provide custom environment variables to a Shiny process using Bash profiles

  * Configure apps to run using the authenticated user's account with custom environment variables from Bash or PAM

  * Launch Shiny apps with a prefix command such as 'nice' allowing you to prioritize compute resources per application or  per user
