As many RStudio customers & open-source users know, we have a lot of websites.  Historically, as the company grew, each department created its own website(s) to convey information about a specific topic.  As a result, it can be hard to know which site contains the information youâ€™re looking for.  Until now, the search box on rstudio.com only searched only 21% of the RStudio websites. 

The Enterprise Information Management team is pleased to launch Sitewide Search on rstudio.com.  Using the search icon on rstudio.com, Sitewide Search will now return content from all of the following sites & subdomains:
* rstudio.com
* rstudio.cloud
* shinyapps.io
* rstudio.com/blog
* blogs.rstudio.com/ai 
* db.rstudio.com
* docs.rstudio.com
* education.rstudio.com
* environments.rstudio.com
* keras.rstudio.com
* packagemanager.rstudio.com
* pkgs.rstudio.com
* rmarkdown.rstudio.com
* rviews.rstudio.com
* shiny.rstudio.com
* solutions.rstudio.com
* spark.rstudio.com 
* support.rstudio.com
* team-admin.rstudio.com
* tensorflow.rstudio.com 

Based on an analysis of search term data from the previous search engine as well as Google Search Console, Sitewide Search results will be broken down into 4 content areas, or "buckets": 
* Product
  + Product includes relevant content from professional product pages on rstudio.com as well as RStudio Cloud and Shinyapps.io. 
* Blogs
  + The Blog results will include content from several of the blogs produced by RStudio: the main RStudio.com Blog, R Views, the RStudio AI Blog, and the historical posts from the Education Blog. 
* Customer Information & Open Source.  
  + Customer Information and Open Source include results relevant to each type of RStudio user.  There is a small amount of content that overlaps between both types of content.

Additionally, users can filter by website name, tags, and categories along the left side of the search results page to refine their search.  For Blogs, Sitewide Search has a toggle button on the left menu to further restrict the search results to the most current 6 months.

Users are likely to experience a more comprehensive and robust set of  search results from previous searches due to the sheer increase in sites included.  Sitewide Search results are also relevancy ranked based on search term matching and where the term(s) appear on the website.

Two sites, status.rstudio.com and dailies.rstudio.com, are not included in Sitewide Search due to the timeline nature of updates to those sites.  Instead, we have included links to both sites on the bottom of the search results pages.  

For this  phase, Sitewide Search is only present on the search box header on rstudio.com.  We will be rolling it out to other sites in the future, though the sites and timeline have not been decided.
