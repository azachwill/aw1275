It's time to share "What's New" in shinyapps.io!

  * ****Custom Domains** - **host your shiny applications on your own domain (Professional Plan only).**  [Learn more](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/custom-domains.html).**

  * **Bigger applications** – include up to 1GB of data with your application bundles!

  * **Bigger packages** – until now[ shinyapps.io](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shinyapps/) could only support installation of packages under 100MB; now it's 1GB! (attention users of BioConductor packages especially)

  * **Better locale detection** – the newest shinyapps package now detects and maps your locale appropriately if it varies from the locale of[ shinyapps.io](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shinyapps)  (you will need to update  your shinyapps package)

  * ****Application deletion - ****you can now delete applications permanently. First archive your application, then delete it. Note: Be careful; all deletes are permanent.

  * **Transfer / Rename accounts -** select a different name for your account or transfer control to another shinyapps.io account holder.

  * ****"What's New" is New **-** your dashboard displays the latest enhancements to shinyapps.io under...you guessed it... "What's New"!
