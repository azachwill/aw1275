We've added a new articles section to the R Markdown development center at [rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles.html](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles.html). Here you can find expert advice and tips on how to use R Markdown efficiently.

In one of the first articles, Richard Layton of [graphdoctor.com](http://www.graphdoctor.com/) explains the best tips for using R Markdown to generate Microsoft Word documents. You'll learn how to

  * set Word styles

  * tweak margins

  * handle relative paths

  * make better tables

  * add bibliographies, and more
