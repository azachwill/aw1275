The TIOBE Company just published the July edition of its <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TIOBE Programming Community Index</a> of programming language popularity. R users will be pleased to see that R is now ranked as the 8th most popular programming language as shown in the screenshot below, having risen 12 positions since July of last year.

While we at RStudio are pleased to see R climbing the TIOBE charts, what we're going to focus on this month is all the other languages, both on this list and not, that data science teams also use to do their jobs. We're going to focus on **interoperability** with R, and how it helps data science teams get more value of all their organization's analytic investments.

If you're a regular reader of this blog, you may already know that the RStudio IDE supports Python (you can read more at <a href="https://rstudio.com/solutions/r-and-python/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R & Python: A Love Story</a>. What's less well-known, however, is that when you write code in R Markdown within the IDE, you may also embed:

- **SQL code** for accessing databases,
- **BASH code** for shell scripts,
- **C and C++ code** using the `Rcpp` package,
- **STAN code** for doing statistical modeling,
- **Javascript** for doing web programming,
- **and many more languages**. You can find a complete list of the many platforms supported in the language engines chapter of the book, <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R Markdown: The Definitive Guide</a>.

If you're wondering how this could work, I've created a very simple example R Markdown document that demonstrates how languages can work together. It creates an in-memory database of `gapminder` data, queries it using SQL, prints the result of the query in R, plots the result using `matplotlib` in Python and saves the result as an image, and then prints the size of the image in BASH.

## Access results of SQL query in R

## Plot in Python and save result as .png
```{{python}}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(r.gmdata.year, r.gmdata.lifeExp)
plt.grid(True)
plt.title("Switzerland Life Expectancy (years)")
plt.savefig("./SwitzerlandLifeExp.png")

## Show size of Python plot using BASH
```{{bash}}

Throughout the month of July, we'll be devoting several articles to how RStudio supports interoperability and the benefits interoperability brings to data science teams. We encourage you to look for those subsequent posts this month. Meanwhile, to learn more about how interoperability improves the productivity of data science teams and some of the many platforms that RStudio supports, we recommend the following resources:
