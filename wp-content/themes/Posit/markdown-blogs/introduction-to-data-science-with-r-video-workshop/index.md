RStudio has teamed up with O'Reilly media to create a new way to learn R!

The [Introduction to Data Science with R video course](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034834.do) is a comprehensive introduction to the R language. It's ideal for non-programmers with no data science experience or for data scientists switching to R from Excel, SAS or other software.

Join RStudio Master Instructor Garrett Grolemund as he covers the three skill sets of data science: computer programming (with R), manipulating data sets (including loading, cleaning, and visualizing data), and modeling data with statistical methods. You'll learn R's syntax and grammar as well as how to load, save, and transform data, generate beautiful graphs, and fit statistical models to the data.

All of the techniques introduced in this video are motivated by real problems that involve real datasets. You'll get plenty of hands-on experience with R (and not just hear about it!), and lots of help if you get stuck.

You'll also learn how to use the ggplot2, reshape2, and dplyr packages.

The course contains over eight hours of instruction. You can access the first hour free from [O'Reilly's website](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034834.do). The course covers the same content as our two day Introduction to Data Science with R workshop, right down to the same exercises. But unlike our workshops, the videos are self-paced, which can help you learn R in a more relaxed way.
