_**Update Nov 2 2015:** Wow, that was fast. Registration is full. If you add yourself to the [waitlist](https://www.eventbrite.com/waitlist?eid=19153967031&tid=0), we'll contact you first if/when we do this conference again._

In the three years since we launched Shiny, our focus has been on helping people get started with Shiny. But there's a huge difference between using Shiny and using it _well_, and we want to start getting serious about helping people use Shiny most effectively. It's the difference between having apps that merely work, and apps that are performant, robust, and maintainable.

That's why RStudio is thrilled to announce the first ever Shiny Developer Conference, to be held at Stanford University on January 30-31, 2016, three months from today. We'll skip past the basics, and dig into principles and practices that will simultaneously simplify and improve the robustness of your code. We'll introduce you to some brand new tools we've created to help you build ever larger and more complex apps. And we'll show you what to do if things go wrong.

Check out the [agenda](http://shiny2016.eventbrite.com/) to see the complete lineup of speakers and talks.

We're capping the conference at just 90 people, so if you'd like to level up your Shiny skills, register now at <http://shiny2016.eventbrite.com>.

Hope to see you there!

_Note that this conference is intended for R users who are already comfortable writing Shiny apps. We won't cover the basics of Shiny app creation at all. If you're looking to get started with Shiny, please see our [tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/)._
