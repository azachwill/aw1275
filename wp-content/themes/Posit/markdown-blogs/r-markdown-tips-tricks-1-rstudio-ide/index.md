The R Markdown file format combines R programming and the markdown language to create dynamic, reproducible documents. R Markdown can be used for reports, slide shows, blogs, books --- even <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/shiny-start.html" target = "_blank">Shiny apps</a>! With so many possibilities, authors learn how to use their tools in effective ways.

We asked our Twitter friends <a href="https://twitter.com/_bcullen/status/1333878752741191680" target = "_blank">the tips and tricks that they have picked up</a> along their R Markdown journey. There was a flurry of insightful replies, ranging from organizing files to working with YAML. We wanted to highlight some of the responses so that you can also use them when creating R Markdown documents.

This is the first of a four-part series to help you on your path to R Markdown success, starting with **working with R Markdown documents in the RStudio IDE.**

**1. Create new chunks with shortcuts**

We understand the pain of typing out all those backticks to create a new chunk, and <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2021/10/unbalanced-delimiters/" target = "_blank">it is also error-prone</a>. Instead, insert an R code chunk by clicking the Insert button on the document toolbar.

</center>
<br>
You can also type the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> (<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> on macOS). Use the shortcut inside a chunk to split it into two:

**2. Run all (or some) chunks**

Within RStudio, the Run button on the right-hand side of the document toolbar opens a drop-down menu. The menu contains handy shortcuts for running code chunks.

For example, you don't have to run chunks individually. Run all chunks below your cursor by clicking **Run All Chunks Below**.

**3. Show plots in the Viewer pane**

By default, code chunks display R Markdown plots "inline", or directly underneath the code chunk. If you would rather see the plot in the Viewer pane, go to **RStudio** \> **Preferences** \> **R Markdown** and unselect "Show output inline for all R Markdown documents".

<center>

</center>

Voilà! Next time you run the document, the plot will show in the Viewer pane as opposed to inline.

**4. Drag and drop formulas from Wikipedia into your R Markdown document**

You can include LaTeX formulas in your R Markdown files. Enclose them between dollar signs (`$`) to see the rendered formula.

Since Wikipedia uses LaTeX HTML formatting on its website, this means you can highlight formulas and drag them into your R Markdown document.

**5. Use the visual markdown editor**

<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" target = "_blank">RStudio v1.4</a> has a visual markdown editing mode. This lets you see what your R Markdown document will look like without knitting. You can edit your document in this mode, as well.

Click the compass button on the far-right end of the document toolbar to switch into visual markdown editing mode.

Alternatively, you can use the <kbd>⇧</kbd>+<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd> keyboard shortcut.

Typing <kbd>⌘/</kbd> finds and inserts what you need into the document:

<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/0q6hpkuvhm.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:94.17% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_0q6hpkuvhm videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;position:relative;width:100%">&nbsp;</div></div></div>

These are only a few of the many features available in the visual markdown editor. Read more in <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/" target = "_blank">the RStudio Visual Markdown Editing documentation</a>.
