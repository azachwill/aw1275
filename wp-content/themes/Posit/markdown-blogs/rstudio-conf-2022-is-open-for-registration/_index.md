# Conference

We're thrilled to announce our keynote speakers:

-   [Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel](https://mine-cr.com/) (Duke University and
    RStudio) and [Julia Stewart Lowndes](https://jules32.github.io/)
    (Openscapes and NCEAS, University of California, Santa Barbara) will
    talk about publishing and collaboration with
    [Quarto](https://quarto.org), the next generation of RMarkdown.
-   [Jeff Leek](https://jtleek.com/) (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
    Center) will talk about the [DataTrail
    program](https://www.datatrail.org) for community-based data science
    training in communities with limited technology training
    opportunities.
-   [Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/) (RStudio) and [Max
    Kuhn](https://www.rstudio.com/authors/max-kuhn/) (RStudio) will talk
    about good practices for applied machine learning, from model
    development to model deployment.

We'll also have over 80 talks in four parallel tracks. You'll learn from
outstanding speakers drawn from the wider R and data-science
communities, as well as RStudio data scientists and engineers. Check out
the [talks from last
year](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/) to get a
sense of the breadth and depth of our typical content.

If you'd like to speak, our [call for
talks](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/save-the-date/#call-for-talks) is
open, and we've extended the deadline to March 28. Talks can be live and
in-person, or remote and pre-recorded, and all speakers will receive
coaching from [Articulation Inc](https://www.articulationinc.com/).

All in-person attendees will be required to be vaccinated and boosted.
Read the details of how we plan to make everyone safe in our [code of
conduct](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/2022-conf-code-of-conduct/).

If you can't make it in person, don't worry! All keynotes and talks will
be live-streamed, you'll be able to ask questions in the same way as
in-person participants, and we're working on ways to virtually connect
you with other attendees. Virtual registration will be free and
available closer to the date.

# Workshops

There will be two days of optional, in-person training before the
conference. This year, we have 15 exciting workshops, ranging from an
introduction to the tidyverse to a masterclass in package development.
This is your opportunity to go deep in topics like graphic design for
[ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), publishing with
[Quarto](https://quarto.org), interactive apps with
[shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/), machine learning with
[tidymodels](http://tidymodels.org/), causal inference, making art with
code, people analytics, and much more! For those new to R and the
tidyverse, we're debuting a new [hybrid
experience](https://www.rstudio.com/academy/) that includes online
learning before and after the in-person workshop. See the complete list
of workshops, who's teaching, and the details of what you'll learn on
the [workshops
page](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/2022-conf-workshops-pricing/).

Please note that rstudio::conf() workshops are very popular and do sell
out quickly. If you want to attend a specific workshop, we highly
recommend signing up well before the conference.

# Diversity scholarships

We will provide 50 diversity scholarships to individuals around the
world who are members of a group underrepresented at rstudio::conf().
These groups include people of color, those with disabilities,
elders/older adults, LGBTQ folks, and women/minority genders. Because we
know there is so much uncertainty around travel, especially for people
outside the United States, diversity scholars can choose to participate
virtually or in person.

Diversity scholarships will include:

-   conference registration,
-   a workshop (either virtual or in person),
-   practical support, if needed, to enable participation in the virtual
    conference (such as an accessibility aid, a resource for internet
    access, or childcare),
-   up to \$1500 in travel support for in-person participants,
-   and, of course, swag!

The workshop for diversity scholars participating virtually will cover
how to get started with Quarto. Diversity scholars participating in
person will choose among the available in-person workshops. Where travel
restrictions allow, travel support for diversity scholars participating
in person will be available. We'll know more details closer to the date,
and we'll do our best to help all diversity scholars.

Applications for the Diversity Scholarship program close on March 21,
2022 [AoE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth).
