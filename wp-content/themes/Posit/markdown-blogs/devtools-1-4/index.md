We're very pleased to announce the release of devtools 1.4. This version brings many improvements to package installation, including automated vignette building, and a better way of referring to repos on github, `install_github("hadley/devtools")`. There are also many other bug fixes and minor improvements; to see them all, please read the [release notes](https://github.com/hadley/devtools/releases/tag/devtools-1.4) file on github.
