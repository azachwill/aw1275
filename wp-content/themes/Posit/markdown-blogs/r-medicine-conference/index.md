We are less than one month away from the [R/Medicine conference](http://www.r-medicine.com/)! Tickets are still available to connect with the R users who are advancing the way we think about human health.

The goal of the R/Medicine conference is to promote the use of the R programming environment and the R ecosystem in medical research and clinical practice. In addition to showcasing novel tools, algorithms and methods for analyzing medical and clinical data, we hope the conference will provide a forum for collaboration within the community.

The keynote speakers will be:

* [Robert Tibshirani](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/) ([@robtibshirani](https://twitter.com/robtibshirani)), Professor of Biomedical Data Science, and Statistics at Stanford University
* [Victoria Stodden](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/faculty/vcs) ([@victoriastodden](https://twitter.com/victoriastodden)), Associate Professor of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
* [Michael Lawrence](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-lawrence-74a9b482) ([@lawremi](https://twitter.com/lawremi)), Core Member of R and Bioconductor and Computational Biologist at Genentech
* [Harlan M Krumholz](https://medicine.yale.edu/intmed/people/harlan_krumholz.profile)([@hmkyale](https://twitter.com/hmkyale)), Professor of Medicine and Professor in the Institute for Social and Policy Studies, Yale University.

Conference talks will address the use of R in medical applications from Phase I clinical trial design through the analysis of the efficacy of medical therapies in public use. Topics include clinical trial design, the analysis of clinical trial data, personalized medicine, the analysis of patient records, the analysis of genetic data, the visualization of medical data, and reproducible research.

Additionally [Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel](https://stat.duke.edu/people/mine-cetinkaya-rundel) will conduct an introductory workshop on [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [Ben Goodrich](http://www.columbia.edu/~bg2382/) will offer a workshop on [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/).

The conference will be held at [The Omni Hotel](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Omni+New+Haven+Hotel+at+Yale/@41.3057418,-72.9296893,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m7!3m6!1s0x89e7d84b45005aef:0x8cfc0fe0a0ceb073!5m1!1s2018-06-03!8m2!3d41.3057378!4d-72.9274953) 155 Temple Street New Haven, CT, just off the Yale campus.
