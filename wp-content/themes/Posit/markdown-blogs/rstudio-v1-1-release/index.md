We're excited to announce the general availability of RStudio 1.1. Highlights include:

- A [connections tab](https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-preview-connections) which makes it easy to connect to, explore, and view data in a variety of databases.
- A [terminal tab](https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-v1-1-preview-terminal) which provides fluid shell integration with the IDE, xterm emulation, and even support for full-screen terminal applications.
- An [object explorer](https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-v1-1-preview-object-explorer) which can navigate deeply nested R data structures and objects.
- A new, modern [dark theme](https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-dark-theme) and Retina-quality icons throughout.
- Dozens of other [small improvements](https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-v1-1-little-things) and bugfixes.

[RStudio Server Pro 1.1](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-server-pro/) is also now available. Some of the [new Pro features](https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-rsp-1-1-features) include:

- Support for floating licenses, which make it easy to run RStudio Server Pro in Docker containers, virtual machines, and cloud computing instances.
- Improved session management, which allows analysts to label, multi-select, force quit and otherwise self-manage their R sessions.
- Tools for administrators, including the ability to send users notifications and automatically clean up unused sessions, freeing disk space and resources.

You can [download RStudio v1.1](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) today, and let us know what you think on the [RStudio IDE community forum](https://community.rstudio.com/c/rstudio-ide).
