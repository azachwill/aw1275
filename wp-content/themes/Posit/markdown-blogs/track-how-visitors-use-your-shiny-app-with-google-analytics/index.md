Want to see who is using your Shiny apps and what they are doing while they are there?

Google Analytics is a popular way to track traffic to your website. With Google Analytics, you can see what sort of person comes to your website, where they arrive from, and what they do while they are there.

Since Shiny apps are web pages, you can also use Google Analytics to keep an eye on who visits your app and how they use it.

[Add Google Analytics to a Shiny app](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/google-analytics.html) is a new article at the [Shiny dev center](https://shiny.rstudio.com) that will show you how to set up analytics for a Shiny app. Some knowledge of jQuery is required.
