The final version of RStudio v0.95 is now [available for download](http://www.rstudio.org/download) from our website (thanks to everyone who put the preview release through its paces over the last couple of weeks!). Highlights of the new release include:

  * **Projects** — A new system for managing R projects that enables easy switching between working directories and per-project contexts for source documents, workspaces, and history.

  * **Code Navigation** — Typeahead navigation by file or function name (Ctrl+.) and the ability to navigate directly to the definition of any function (F2 or Ctrl+Click).

  * **Version Control** — Integrated support for Git and Subversion, including changelist management, diffing/staging, and project history.

Quite a bit has been added to RStudio since the initial v0.92 release a year ago. We've put together a new screencast that includes a quick tour of the product and also highlights some of the new features in v0.95:

There is also an [interview](http://www.decisionstats.com/interview-jj-allaire-founder-rstudio/) with RStudio founder JJ Allaire over on DecisionStats that has a more in-depth discussion of the release and the RStudio project in general.

The evolution of RStudio is a direct result of the many in-depth conversations we've had with users at meetups, conferences, and on our support forum. We realize that there's plenty more to do and hope we can keep up with all of the great feedback! In that spirit we hope to see lots of folks this Thursday night at the [Chicago RUG meetup](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRUG/events/47339512/) as well as in February in [Houston](http://www.meetup.com/houstonr/events/48026172/) and [Los Angeles](http://www.meetup.com/LAarea-R-usergroup/).
