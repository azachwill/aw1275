Registration is now open for the next Master R Development workshop led by Hadley Wickham, author of over 30 R packages and the [Advanced R](http://http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) book. The workshop will be held on January 19 and 20th in the San Francisco bay area.

The workshop is a two day course on advanced R practices and package development. You'll learn the three main paradigms of R programming: functional programming, object oriented programming and metaprogramming, as well as how to make R packages, the key to well-documented, well-tested and easily-distributed R code.
