RStudio is planning a new Master R Developer Workshop to be taught by Hadley Wickham in the San Francisco Bay Area on January 19-20. This will be the same workshop that Hadley is teaching in [September in New York City](http://rstudionyc.eventbrite.com) to a sold out audience.

If you did not get a chance to register for the NYC workshop but wished to, consider attending the January Bay Area workshop. We will open registration once we have planned out all of the event details. If you would like to be notified when registration opens, leave a contact address [here](http://pages.rstudio.net/Master-R-Workshop.html).
