When I look back on rstudio::conf(2022), I wish that there were five of me that could have attended: One to watch and learn from all the talks on the incredible work people are doing and sharing to advance data science, education, and community; another for the ‘hallway track’ to meet and talk with people and hear what everyone is excited about, and the things we’re struggling with too; another to participate in the online community talking with and connecting with people all over the world; another to meet amazing co-workers, many for the first time; and finally one to just watch and listen and feel a part of this special community. Luckily the learning, sharing, and connecting don’t end with the conference, and I’m enjoying the opportunity to watch <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/blog/talks-and-workshops-from-rstudio-conf-2022/" target = "_blank">talk recordings</a>. 

Let me know if there are other things you’d like to see in the newsletter and follow along at <a href="https://twitter.com/rstudio_glimpse" target = "_blank">@rstudio_glimpse</a> too!

## Roundup

* **RStudio is becoming Posit in October!** In J.J.Allaire and Hadley Wickham’s <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/blog/rstudio-is-becoming-posit/" target = "_blank">blog post</a> and <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/keynotes/rstudio-2022-beyond/" target = "_blank">rstudio::conf(2022) keynote</a>, they share our mission and why Posit is the right name for this new phase in RStudio’s development. Our mission is the creation of free and open-source software for data science, scientific research, and technical communication. This mission intentionally goes beyond “R for Data Science”— with Posit, we hope to take the approach that’s succeeded with R and apply it more broadly. But no, Hadley will not be learning Python, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1552290395454951424?s=20&t=iXTWkCDXrGeWnvr9be89xg" target = "_blank">hex stickers</a> for packages aren’t going anywhere!
* **Announcing Quarto,** <a href="[a new open source scientific and technical publishing system]" target = "_blank">a new open source scientific and technical publishing system</a>). Quarto is the next iteration of R Markdown, and allows you can create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable, author documents as plain text markdown or Jupyter notebooks, and output to multiple format types.Get started learning about Quarto through <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/" target = "_blank">the tutorials</a>, Tom Mock’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvi5uXQMvu4" target = "_blank">‘Welcome to Quarto’ workshop</a>, and Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel’s <a href="https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-tip-a-day/" target = "_blank">Quarto tip a day</a>.

## Selected new releases

<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/gt/releases/tag/v0.7.0" target = "_blank">gt v0.7.0 </a>
<br>
With the <a href="https://gt.rstudio.com/" target = "_blank">{gt}</a> package, anyone can make wonderful-looking tables using the R programming language. There are lots of new features in this release, including the ability to export gt tables as Word documents, easier production of colorful and stylish tables, and many accessibility enhancements for HTML table outputs.

<br>
This release of <a href="https://yihui.org/knitr/" target = "_blank">{knitr}</a> includes the addition of a new "graphics device" that allows for the export of grid graphics to SVG, which can make graphics more accessible and a new function `convert_chunk_header()` to help convert from `.Rmd`  to `.qmd`.

<a href="https://mlverse.github.io/luz/" target = "_blank">{luz}</a> is a high-level API for <a href="https://torch.mlverse.org/" target = "_blank">torch for R</a>, a machine learning framework based on PyTorch, that aims to encapsulate the training loop into a set of reusable pieces of code. It reduces the boilerplate required to train a model with torch, avoids the error-prone `zero_grad()` - `backward()` - `step()` sequence of calls, and also simplifies the process of moving data and models between CPUs and GPUs. This release brings a few improvements to the learning rate finder and, with the 0.2.0 release, supports R matrices/arrays as input data and adds in new built-in callbacks.

### tidyverse
