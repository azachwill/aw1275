The [Joint Statistics Meetings](https://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2015/) starting August 8 is the biggest meetup for statisticians in the world. Navigating the sheer quantity of interesting talks is challenging - there can be up to 50 sessions going on at a time!

To prepare for Seattle, we asked RStudio's Chief Data Scientist Hadley Wickham for his top session picks. Here are 9 talks, admittedly biased towards R, graphics, and education, that really interested him and might interest you, too.

Hear [Jake Porway](http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/the-numbers-game/), [Patrick Ball](https://hrdag.org/patrickball/), and [Dino Citraro](https://about.me/dinocitraro) talk about using data to do good. Of all the sessions, you shouldn't miss, this is the one you _really_ shouldn't miss. (But unfortunately it conflicts with another great session - you have difficult choices ahead.)

[Statistics at Scale: Applications from Tech Companies
](https://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2015/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=211368)Wednesday, 0830-1020, CC-204
[Hilary Parker](http://hilaryparker.com) has organised a fantastic session where you'll learn how companies like Etsy, Microsoft, and Facebook do statistics at scale. Get there early because this session is going to be PACKED!

There are hundreds of sessions at the JSM, so no doubt we've missed other great ones. If you think we've missed a "don't miss" session, please add it to the comments so others can find it.

## Visit RStudio at booth #435

In between session times you'll find the RStudio team hanging out at booth #435 in the expo center (at the far back on the right). Please stop by and say hi! We'll have stickers to show your R pride and printed copies of many of [our cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

See you in Seattle!
