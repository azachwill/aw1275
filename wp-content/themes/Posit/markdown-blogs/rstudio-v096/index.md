Today a new version of RStudio (v0.96) is [available for download](http://www.rstudio.org/download/) from our website. The main focus of this release is improved tools for authoring, reproducible research, and web publishing. This means lots of new [Sweave](http://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/Sweave/) features as well as tight integration with the [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package (including support for creating dynamic web reports with the new R Markdown and R HTML formats).

We've also added some other frequently requested editing features including code folding. Here's a short video demo of the new authoring and web publishing features:

We're particularly excited about the new possibilities opened up by R Markdown, which make it easier than ever to create web content with R. On June 5th in New York we'll talking about the latest releases of knitr and RStudio with Yihui Xie (knitr) and Jeff Horner (R/Apache and Rook):

We'll also be announcing some more new stuff at the meetupâ€”hope to see you there!

You can [download RStudio 0.96](http://www.rstudio.org/download/) from our website now. Here's a list of all the new features:
