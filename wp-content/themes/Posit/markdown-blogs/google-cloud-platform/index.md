RStudio is excited to announce the availability of RStudio Server Pro on the Google Cloud Platform.

RStudio Server Pro GCP is identical to [RStudio Server Pro](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-server-pro/), but with additional convenience for data scientists, including pre-installation of multiple versions of R, common systems libraries, and the [BigQuery package for R](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/bigrquery-0-4-0/).

RStudio Server Pro GCP adapts to your unique circumstances. It allows you to choose different GCP computing instances for RStudio Server Pro no matter how large, whenever a project requires it (hourly pricing).

If the enhanced security, support for multiple R versions and multiple sessions, and commercially licensed and supported features of RStudio Server Pro appeal to you, please give RStudio Server Pro for GCP a try. Below are some useful links to get you started:
