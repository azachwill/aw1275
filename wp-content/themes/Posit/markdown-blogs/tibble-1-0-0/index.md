I'm pleased to announce tibble, a new package for manipulating and printing data frames in R. Tibbles are a modern reimagining of the data.frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not. The name comes from dplyr: originally you created these objects with `tbl_df()`, which was most easily pronounced as "tibble diff".

Install tibble with:

```{{r}}
install.packages("tibble")
```

This package extracts out the `tbl_df` class associated functions from dplyr. [Kirill MÃ¼ller](https://github.com/krlmlr) extracted the code from dplyr, enhanced the tests, and added a few minor improvements.

## Creating tibbles

You can create a tibble from an existing object with `as_data_frame()`:

```{{r}}
as_data_frame(iris)
#> Source: local data frame [150 x 5]
#>
#>    Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
#>           (dbl)       (dbl)        (dbl)       (dbl)  (fctr)
#> 1           5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
#> 2           4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
#> 3           4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
#> 4           4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
#> 5           5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
#> 6           5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa
#> 7           4.6         3.4          1.4         0.3  setosa
#> 8           5.0         3.4          1.5         0.2  setosa
#> 9           4.4         2.9          1.4         0.2  setosa
#> 10          4.9         3.1          1.5         0.1  setosa
#> ..          ...         ...          ...         ...     ...
```

This works for data frames, lists, matrices, and tables.

You can also create a new tibble from individual vectors with `data_frame()`:

```{{r}}
data_frame(x = 1:5, y = 1, z = x ^ 2 + y)
#> Source: local data frame [5 x 3]
#>
#>       x     y     z
#>   (int) (dbl) (dbl)
#> 1     1     1     2
#> 2     2     1     5
#> 3     3     1    10
#> 4     4     1    17
#> 5     5     1    26
```

`data_frame()` does much less than `data.frame()`: it never changes the type of the inputs (e.g. it never converts strings to factors!), it never changes the names of variables, and it never creates `row.names()`. You can read more about these features in the vignette, `vignette("tibble")`.

You can define a tibble row-by-row with `frame_data()`:

```{{r}}
frame_data(
  ~x, ~y,  ~z,
  "a", 2,  3.6,
  "b", 1,  8.5
)
#> Source: local data frame [2 x 3]
#>
#>       x     y     z
#>   (chr) (dbl) (dbl)
#> 1     a     2   3.6
#> 2     b     1   8.5
```

## Tibbles vs data frames

There are two main differences in the usage of a data frame vs a tibble: printing, and subsetting.

Tibbles have a refined print method that shows only the first 10 rows, and all the columns that fit on screen. This makes it much easier to work with large data. In addition to its name, each column reports its type, a nice feature borrowed from `str()`:

```{{r}}
library(nycflights13)
flights
#> Source: local data frame [336,776 x 16]
#>
#>     year month   day dep_time dep_delay arr_time arr_delay carrier tailnum
#>    (int) (int) (int)    (int)     (dbl)    (int)     (dbl)   (chr)   (chr)
#> 1   2013     1     1      517         2      830        11      UA  N14228
#> 2   2013     1     1      533         4      850        20      UA  N24211
#> 3   2013     1     1      542         2      923        33      AA  N619AA
#> 4   2013     1     1      544        -1     1004       -18      B6  N804JB
#> 5   2013     1     1      554        -6      812       -25      DL  N668DN
#> 6   2013     1     1      554        -4      740        12      UA  N39463
#> 7   2013     1     1      555        -5      913        19      B6  N516JB
#> 8   2013     1     1      557        -3      709       -14      EV  N829AS
#> 9   2013     1     1      557        -3      838        -8      B6  N593JB
#> 10  2013     1     1      558        -2      753         8      AA  N3ALAA
#> ..   ...   ...   ...      ...       ...      ...       ...     ...     ...
#> Variables not shown: flight (int), origin (chr), dest (chr), air_time
#>   (dbl), distance (dbl), hour (dbl), minute (dbl).
```

Tibbles are strict about subsetting. If you try to access a variable that does not exist, you'll get an error:

```{{r}}
flights$yea
#> Error: Unknown column 'yea'
```

Tibbles also clearly delineate `[` and `[[`: `[` always returns another tibble, `[[` always returns a vector. No more `drop = FALSE`!

```{{r}}
class(iris[ , 1])
#> [1] "numeric"
class(iris[ , 1, drop = FALSE])
#> [1] "data.frame"
class(as_data_frame(iris)[ , 1])
#> [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
```

## Interacting with legacy code

A handful of functions are don't work with tibbles because they expect `df[, 1]` to return a vector, not a data frame. If you encounter one of these functions, use `as.data.frame()` to turn a tibble back to a data frame:

```{{r}}
class(as.data.frame(tbl_df(iris)))
```
