As we've discussed in recent blog posts on <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/05/19/driving-real-lasting-value-with-serious-data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Serious Data Science</a>, <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/07/15/interoperability-maximize-analytic-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interoperability</a>, and <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/07/28/practical-interoperability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R and Python</a>, RStudio, PBC is dedicated to investing in free and open-source software for data science and helping people understand and improve the world through data. We use our commercial software to fund this investment and focus on helping our customers leverage their investment in open source languages, such as R and Python, and scale them across their entire organization while meeting their enterprise requirements.

Generally, we measure our success by the satisfaction of our users and customers. We have been gratified and humbled to have millions of people using our open source offerings (such as the <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RStudio IDE</a>, <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shiny</a>, and the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tidyverse</a> packages), and thousands of organizations using our commercial software (such as <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RStudio Team</a> and <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RStudio Cloud</a>.

However, as our commercial products are used more widely by larger enterprises, there are times when our product champions look for third party validation of our products, especially when discussing them with buyers and decision makers in IT and lines of business. With that in mind, we are excited and gratified to announce that Forrester Research has named us a Strong Performer in <a href="https://rstudio.com/forrester" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Forrester Wave™: Notebook-Based Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning, Q3 2020</a>.

## RStudio Named a Strong Performer

> "RStudio Team provides the core functionality for enterprise teams 
> that primarily want to use R and some Python to 
> develop and deploy their models....at a rock-bottom price."

The Forrester Wave™: Notebook-Based Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning, Q3 2020 focuses on code-first data science platforms, which "...bring software development discipline to otherwise unruly data science processes, increasing productivity, boosting collaboration, and improving time-to-value." These platforms also make "...individual data scientists dramatically more productive, especially by providing collaboration capabilities for teams." The report also describes the importance of open source data science, including R and Python, to give organizations access to the latest and greatest in machine learning algorithms and to help attract top data science talent.

In this report, we were named a Strong Performer by this independent research firm, and we received the highest scores possible in the evaluation criteria of security, apps, open source, and platform infrastructure. We believe these results validate our approach to our core market, which focuses on open source, code-first, serious data science.

We are excited to share these results with you and encourage you to read <a href="https://rstudio.com/forrester" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forrester's full report</a> for details.
