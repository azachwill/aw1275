## Upgraded Operating System

Each RStudio Cloud project is deployed into its own container - we have upgraded the operating system in these containers to Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) for all new projects. This will ensure that you can use the latest versions of R and python packages with confidence that the underlying operating system has the features they require.

For existing projects, you can choose to upgrade to the updated operating system as well. At the end of May 2021, we will automatically upgrade any project still using the older operating system (Ubuntu 16.04) the next time it is opened.

## Export Project

You can export the contents of a project as a .zip file directly from any projects listing. You don’t  need to open the project first in order to create and download the .zip file. This feature lets you easily work on a project locally if you have the RStudio IDE installed on your computer.

## Teaching with Cloud Guide

For those of you using Cloud to help with your teaching, we’ve added a <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/learn/guide#course-spaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teaching with Cloud</a> section to the <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/learn/guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guide</a> to help you get started. It lays out the typical steps to take to use Cloud with your students - and covers questions that are frequently asked by educators.

## Compare Plans Page

To make it easier to understand how our plans measure up against one another, we’ve added a <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/plans/compare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compare Plans</a> page that lists all our plans, their features and pricing options, in a single table.

## What’s Next

We don’t like to pre-announce features before they’re available, but the team is busy both improving our underlying systems and developing new features. If there is something you’d love to see improved or added to Cloud, please let us know in the <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/c/rstudio-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RStudio Cloud section</a> of the RStudio Community site.
