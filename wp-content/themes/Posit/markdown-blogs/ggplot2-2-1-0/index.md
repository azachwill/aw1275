I'm very pleased to announce the release of ggplot2 2.1.0, scales 0.4.0, and gtable 0.2.0. These are set of relatively minor updates that fix a whole bunch of little problems that crept in during the [last big update](https://blog.rstudio.com/2015/12/21/ggplot2-2-0-0/). The most important changes are described below.

  1. When mapping an aesthetic to a constant the default guide title is the name of the aesthetic (i.e. "colour"), not the value (i.e. "loess"). This is a really handy technique for labelling individual layers:

```{{r}}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, 1 / hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, aes(colour = "lm"), se = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(aes(colour = "loess"), se = FALSE)
```

  2. `stat_bin()` (which powers `geom_histogram()` and `geom_freqpoly()`), has been overhauled to use the same algorithm as ggvis. This has considerably better parameters and defaults thanks to the work of [Randall Pruim](http://www.calvin.edu/~rpruim/). Changes include:

    * Better arguments and a better algorithm for determining the origin. You can now specify either `boundary` (i.e. the position of the left or right side) or the `center` of a bin. `origin` has been deprecated in favour of these arguments.

    * `drop` is deprecated in favour of `pad`, which adds extra 0-count bins at either end, as is needed for frequency polygons. `geom_histogram()` defaults to `pad = FALSE` which considerably improves the default limits for the histogram, especially when the bins are big.

    * The default algorithm does a (somewhat) better job at picking nice widths and origins across a wider range of input data.

You can see the impact of these changes on the following two histograms:

```{{r}}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, boundary = 0)
```

  3. All layer functions (`geom_*()` + `stat_*()`) functions now have a consistent argument order: `data`, `mapping`, then `geom`/`stat`/`position`, then `...`, then layer specific arguments, then common layer arguments. This might break some code if you were relying on partial name matching, but in the long-term should make ggplot2 easier to use. In particular, you can now set the `n` parameter in `geom_density2d()` without it partially matching `na.rm`.

  4. For geoms with both `colour` and `fill`, `alpha` once again only affects fill. `alpha` was changed to modify both `colour` and `fill` in 2.0.0, but I've reverted it to the old behaviour because it was causing pain for quite a few people.
