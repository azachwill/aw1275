<p style="text-align: center;">We're excited to announce the <strong>official release of RStudio 1.2</strong>!</p>

### What's new in RStudio 1.2? 

Over a year in the making, this new release of RStudio includes dozens of new productivity enhancements and capabilities. You'll now find RStudio a more comfortable workbench for working in [SQL](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/10/02/rstudio-1-2-preview-sql/), [Stan](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/10/16/rstudio-1-2-preview-stan/), [Python](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/10/09/rstudio-1-2-preview-reticulated-python/), and [D3](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/10/05/r2d3-r-interface-to-d3-visualizations/). Testing your R code is easier, too, with integrations for [shinytest and testthat](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/10/18/shinytest-automated-testing-for-shiny-apps/). Create, and test, and publish APIs in R with [Plumber](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/10/23/rstudio-1-2-preview-plumber-integration/). And get more done with [background jobs](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/03/14/rstudio-1-2-jobs/), which let you run R scripts while you work.

Underpinning it all is a new rendering engine based on modern Web standards, so RStudio Desktop looks sharp on displays large and small, and performs better everywhere -- especially if you're using the latest Web technology in your visualizations, Shiny applications, and R Markdown documents. Don't like how it looks now? No problem--just [make your own theme](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/10/29/rstudio-ide-custom-theme-support/). 

You can read more about what's new this release in the [release notes](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/release-notes/), or our [RStudio 1.2 blog series](https://blog.rstudio.com/categories/rstudio-ide).
