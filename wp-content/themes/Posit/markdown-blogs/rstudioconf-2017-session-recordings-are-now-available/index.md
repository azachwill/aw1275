Couldn't make it to Orlando in January?  We're excited to bring you the next best thing.

Whether you missed the conference, missed a talk, or just want to refresh your memory, you can find all the recordings from the first ever conference about All Things R & RStudio at https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/#rstudioconf. Just click on +rstudio::conf 2017 when you get there to expand the list.

Of course, the session recordings can't capture the complete "in person" experience. You had to be there to immerse in the 2 day workshops led by Hadley Wickham, Garrett Grolemund, and Joe Cheng; join in cocktails and conversation at the Datacamp Happy Hour; attend the exclusive Friday evening access to Universal Studio's Wizarding World of Harry Potter under a full moon; hang out at the RStudio Connect lounge and with our friends from Cloudera, Mango Solutions, MetrumRG, Quantide, and Supstat; or make and renew friendships with more than 400 attendees from every line of work and the entire RStudio team. We hope you'll consider joining us in January 2018 - location and exact dates still to be announced.

In the meantime, the recordings showcase some of the most interesting uses of R and RStudio for everyone.

Enjoy and share!
