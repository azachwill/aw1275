RStudio is excited to announce the general availability (GA) of [shinyapps.io](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shinyapps/).

Shinyapps.io is an easy to use, secure, and scalable hosted service already being used by thousands of professionals and students to deploy Shiny applications on the web. Effective today, shinyapps.io has completed _beta_ testing and is generally available as a commercial service for anyone.

As regular readers of our blog know, [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is a popular free and open source R package from RStudio that simplifies the creation of interactive web applications, dashboards, and reports. Until today, [Shiny Server and Shiny Server Pro](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/) were the most popular ways to share shiny apps. Now, there is a commercially supported alternative for individuals and groups who don't have the time or resources to install and manage their own servers.

We want to thank the nearly 8,000 people who created at least one shiny app and deployed it on shinyapps.io during its extensive alpha and beta testing phases! The service was improved for everyone because of your willingness to give us feedback and bear with us as we continuously added to its capabilities.

For R users developing shiny applications that haven't yet created a shinyapps.io account, we hope you'll give it a try soon!  We did our best to keep the pricing simple and predictable with Free, Basic, Standard, and Professional plans. Each paid plan has features and functionality that we think will appeal to different users and can be purchased with a credit card by month or year. You can learn more about [shinyapps.io pricing plans](https://www.rstudio.com/pricing/#ShinyApp) and product features on our website.

We hope to see your shiny app on shinyapps.io soon!
