We've received requests from a number of you to [submit talks for rstudio::global()](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/07/17/rstudio-global-call-for-talks/) after the deadline (tomorrow, August 14). We know things are particuarly tough at the moment, so we're extending the deadline by two weeks for everyone; **the new submission deadline is August 28** at 11:59PM PDT. We'll aim to get decisions back by late September.
