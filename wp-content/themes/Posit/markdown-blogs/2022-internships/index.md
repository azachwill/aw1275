We’re excited to announce our 2022 Summer Internship Program. Through the program, students will be able to apply for full-time summer internships within one of the departments of RStudio. The program allows students to do impactful work that helps both RStudio users and the broader community, and ensures that the community of developers and educators is just as diverse as its community of users.

Internship projects will give you hands-on experience, exposure to a collaborative culture, and opportunities to sharpen problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. You will acquire professional experience and work with knowledgeable data scientists, software developers, and educators to create and share new tools and ideas. 

These are paid internships for 12 weeks, and there are two cohorts, starting either May 9th or June 13th, depending on your school schedule. To qualify, you must currently be a student, (broadly construed - if you think you’re a student, you probably are), have some experience writing code, and using Git and GitHub. To demonstrate these skills, your application needs to include a link to a package, Shiny app, data analysis repository, or other software or educational materials. It’s OK if you create something specifically for this application: we just need to know that you’re already familiar with the mechanics of collaborative software development. The postings will remain open until filled, but for a full review, best to get your application in by **March 7, 2022.**

RStudio is a geographically distributed team which means you can be based anywhere in the United States. We hope to expand the program to other countries in the future, but for this year you must legally be able to work in the United States. You will be working 100% remotely and you will meet with your mentor regularly online.
