## Training days: Monday-Tuesday, Jan 27-28

Preceding the conference on Monday and Tuesday, January 27-28, RStudio will offer two days of optional in-person training. This year, we've expanded our training program to include 19 workshops taught by experts throughout the R community. These workshops span 3 categories of learning:

* Introductory: Workshops that require minimal or no R experience
* Intermediate/Advanced: Workshops that expand your existing R knowledge and focus on a specialized area of R
* Professional Development: Workshops focusing on professional skills that complement your R knowledge.

## Who should go?

[rstudio::conf](https://cvent.me/1DdKa?RefId=dev-blog&utm_source=DevBlog&utm_medium=Site&utm_campaign=Site%20Promo) is for RStudio users, R administrators, and RStudio partners who want to learn how to write better Shiny applications, explore all the capabilities of R Markdown, work effectively with Spark or TensorFlow, build predictive models, understand the tidyverse of tools for data science, build tidy tools themselves, discover production-ready development & deployment practices, earn certification as a trainer for Shiny or the Tidyverse, or become a certified administrator of RStudio professional products.

## Why do people go to rstudio::conf?

Because there is simply no better way to learn about all things R & RStudio.

> After #rstudioconf, I shut my laptop for four days to decompress, marinate

> be more excited to start coding again and *this feeling* is why I love the
> R community so much.

> Thing I learned at #Rstudioconf that sticks out to me the most: it turns out 
> that this group of people who are so kind and welcoming online are also kind 
> and welcoming in real life. More than any library or api thatâ€™s what makes 
> #rstats great.
