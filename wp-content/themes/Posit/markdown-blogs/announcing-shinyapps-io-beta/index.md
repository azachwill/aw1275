RStudio is happy to announce the availability of the [shinyapps.io _beta_](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shinyapps/).

Shinyapps.io is an easy to use, secure, and scalable hosted service already being used by thousands of professionals and students to deploy Shiny applications on the web. Today we are releasing a significant upgrade as we transition from _alpha_ to _beta,_ the final step before general availability (GA) later this quarter.

New Feature Highlights in shinyapps.io _beta_

  * Secure and manage authorized users with support for new authentication systems, including Google, GitHub, or a shinyapps.io account.

  * Tune application performance by controlling the resources available. Run multiple R processes per application instance and add application instances.

  * Track performance metrics and simplify application management in a new shinyapps.io dashboard. See an application's active connections, CPU, memory, and network usage. Review application logs, start, stop, restart, rebuild and archive applications all from one convenient place.

During the beta period, these and all other features in shinyapps.io are available at no charge. At the end of the beta, users may subscribe to a plan of their choice or transition their applications to the free plan.

If you do not already have an account, we encourage anyone developing Shiny applications to consider shinyapps.io _beta_ and appreciate any and all feedback on our features or [proposed packaging and pricing](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shinyapps/#ShinyApp).

Happy New Year!
