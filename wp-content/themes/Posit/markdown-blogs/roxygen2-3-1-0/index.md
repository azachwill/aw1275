We're pleased to announce a new version of roxygen2. The biggest news is that roxygen2 now recognises reference class method docstrings and will automatically add them to the documentation. 3.1.0 also offers a number of minor improvements and bug fixes, as listed on the [github release](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen/releases/tag/v3.1.0) notice.

As always, you can install the latest version with `install.packages("roxygen2").`
