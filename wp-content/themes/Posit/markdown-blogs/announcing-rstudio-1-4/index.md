## RStudio 1.4 Delivers Essential Tooling for Serious Data Science

We've written before about <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/blog/2020-07-09-why-you-need-a-world-class-ide-to-do-serious-data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how a world class IDE is a requirement for any team that wants to do serious data science</a>. However, whenever a new release of an installed product comes out, it always raises the question, "What value will my team get from upgrading?" For data science teams committed to <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/05/19/driving-real-lasting-value-with-serious-data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">serious data science</a>, we believe RStudio 1.4 is a must-have upgrade because it:

- **Expands code credibility through transparency:** Improved support for Python and what-you-see-is-what-you-mean R Markdown means that more data science content can share a common development workflow for all team members. This lowering of barriers between developers, leaders, and business people increases the credibility of the data science.
- **Increases agility in the development process:** Many of the new features in RStudio 1.4 are about speeding the development of code, regardless of the data scientist's preferred language or development environment. When developers don't have to switch environments to use a new tool or apply a new test, data science gets done faster.
- **Enhances the reach and durability of the data science platform:** Almost all of the new features noted above are available in both the open-source and professional versions of the RStudio platform. Data science leaders don't have to worry about whether they can afford this upgrade; the new version of RStudio 1.4 is available to all users, including those who don't pay us a penny.

We believe RStudio 1.4's support for a single development environment that supports multiple language platforms will help address many data science challenges that teams will face in 2021. We expect that many organizations will find it to be <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/07/15/interoperability-maximize-analytic-investments/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the key to unlocking new value from their data science investments</a>.
