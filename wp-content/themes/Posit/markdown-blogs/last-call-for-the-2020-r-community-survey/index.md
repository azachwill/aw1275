On December 11, RStudio launched our third annual R Community Survey (formerly known as the Learning R Survey) to better understand how and why people learn and use the R language and associated tools. That survey closes TOMORROW, January 8, 2021. We encourage anyone who is interested in R to respond. The survey should only require 5 to 10 minutes to complete, depending on how little or how much information you choose to share with us. You can find the survey here:

-   English version: <a href="https://rstd.io/r-survey-en"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://rstd.io/r-survey-en</a>
-   Spanish version: <a href="https://rstd.io/r-survey-es"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://rstd.io/r-survey-es</a>

If you don't know R yet or use Python or Julia more than R, that's fine too! The survey has specific questions for you, and your responses will help us better understand how we can be more encouraging to you and others like you.

Data and analysis of the 2018 and 2019 community survey data can be found on github at <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/r-community-survey"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/rstudio/r-community-survey</a> in the 2018/ and 2019/ folders. Results from the 2020 survey will also be posted as free and open source data that github repo in February 2021.

Please ask your students, Twitter followers, Ultimate Frisbee team, and anyone else you think may be interested to complete the survey. Your efforts will help RStudio, educators, and users understand and grow our data science community.

You will find a full disclosure of what information will be collected and how it will be used on the first page of the survey. The survey does not collect personally identifiable information nor email addresses, but it does have optional demographic questions.

Thank you in advance for your consideration and time. We look forward to sharing the results with you next month!
