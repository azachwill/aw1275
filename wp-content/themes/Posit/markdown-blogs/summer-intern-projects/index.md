This summer we had [five interns](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/04/18/summer-interns/) participate in our [internship program](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/02/12/summer-interns/). Each intern was here for 10 weeks and worked closely with a mentor or team. Everyone jumped right in and contributed quickly. We are excited about the progress our interns made and wanted to share it with you here!

Fanny Chow ([@Fannystats](https://twitter.com/fannystats)) worked with Max Kuhn on bootstrapping methods in the rsample package. Check out her blog post [here](http://fbchow.rbind.io/2018/07/27/rstudio-summer-internship/). 

Alex Hayes ([@alexpghayes](https://twitter.com/alexpghayes?lang=en)) work on a major new release of the \`broom\` package featuring more modern behavior, new tidiers, new documentation and some refactoring of package internals. He wrote a [blog post](http://www.alexpghayes.com/blog/a-summer-with-rstudio/.) about his experience. 

Dana Seidel ([@dpseidel](https://twitter.com/dpseidel)) worked with Hadley this summer preparing the scales 1.0.0 release and improving themes and secondary axis functionality in ggplot2. Read more about her summer projects on her [blog](https://www.danaseidel.com/2018-09-01-ATidySummer/) and take a look at [slides](https://www.danaseidel.com/MeetUpSlides) from her September 19th talk introducing the scales package to RLadies-SF.  

Timothy Mastny ([@timmastny](https://twitter.com/timmastny)) worked with Winston Chang and the Shiny team on Sass. Sass is a CSS compiler that will help make dynamic themes for Shiny apps and other R packages. He made this [R package](https://github.com/rstudio/sass) from the internship. 

Irene Steves ([@i_steves](https://twitter.com/i_steves)) worked with Jenny Bryan on The Tidies of March. Here's a [link](https://irene.rbind.io/post/summer-rstudio/) to her blog post. Irene also [presented](https://isteves.github.io/paris/rladies.html#1) at  R-Ladies in Paris.

Thank you again to our interns and Hadley, Max, Jenny, Winston, and Dave!
