Weâ€™re excited to team up with [EODA](https://www.eoda.de/en/), an RStudio [Full Service Certified Partner](https://www.rstudio.com/certified-partners/), to host a free data science in production event in Frankfurt, Germany, on June 13. This one-day event will be geared for data science and IT teams that want to learn how to integrate their analysis solutions with the optimal IT infrastructure.

This is a great chance to work in smaller groups with experts from EODA and RStudio on best-practice approaches to productive data-science architectures, and to see real-world solutions to deployment problems. 

With sessions in English and German, the conference will start with a high-level overview of the right interaction between data science and IT, and then focus on more hands-on solutions to engineering problems such as building APIs with Plumber and deploying to RStudio Connect, using Python and SQL in the RStudio IDE, and Shiny load testing.
