We've added two new tools that make it even easier to learn Shiny.

## Video tutorial

![01-How-to-start](https://rstudioblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/01-how-to-start-002.png)

The [How to Start with Shiny training video](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial) provides a new way to teach yourself Shiny. The video covers everything you need to know to build your own Shiny apps. You'll learn:

  * The architecture of a Shiny app

  * A template for making apps quickly

  * The basics of building Shiny apps

  * How to add sliders, drop down menus, buttons, and more to your apps

  * How to share Shiny apps

  * How to control reactions in your apps to

    * update displays

    * trigger code

    * reduce computation

    * delay reactions

  * How to add design elements to your apps

  * How to customize the layout of an app

  * How to style your apps with CSS

Altogether, the video contains two hours and 25 minutes of material organized around a navigable table of contents.

Best of all, the video tutorial is completely free. The video is the result of our recent How to Start Shiny [webinar series](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/). Thank you to everyone who attended and made the series a success!

## New cheat sheet

The [new Shiny cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) provides an up-to-date reference to the most important Shiny functions.

The cheat sheet replaces the previous cheat sheet, adding new sections on single-file apps, reactivity, CSS and more. The new sheet also gave us a chance to apply some of the things we've learned about making cheat sheets since the original Shiny cheat sheet came out.
