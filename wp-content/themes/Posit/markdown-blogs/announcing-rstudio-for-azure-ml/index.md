## Machine Learning Development in the Cloud

Cloud platforms enable the machine learning lifecycle with variable scaling, lower start-up costs, and centralized data lakes. Data scientists who use these resources in conjunction with their favorite tools can more efficiently build high-quality models at scale.

RStudio supports cloud strategies in <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/solutions/rstudio-in-the-cloud/" target = "_blank">various ways</a>. Our partnerships allow data scientists to operationalize machine learning on their preferred cloud platform using our professional products, built to be the best tools for open source data science.

## Access RStudio Workbench Within Your Azure ML Cloud Environment

RStudio Workbench is the ideal platform for code-first data science development. With this offering, data scientists can start a single-user instance of RStudio Workbench from within their Azure ML environment as part of the machine learning lifecycle.

With RStudio Workbench, data scientists can:

* Program in R or Python in your preferred IDE (RStudio, VSCode, JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook)
* Build models with your favorite open-source tools such as the tidyverse and Shiny
* Access pre-installed packages to support your data science work
* Improve data connectivity via the RStudio Pro Drivers
* Run scripts in the background as local launcher jobs
* Select multiple versions of R and Python
* Open multiple R and Python sessions
* Receive end-user support
