On January 28 and 29, 2016, Hadley Wickham will teach his popular Master R Developer Workshop at [the Westin San Francisco Airport](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Westin+San+Francisco+Airport/@37.603403,-122.376052,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xffffcdd47141a784).  The workshop is offered only 3 times a year and the San Francisco class is already nearly 50% full. This is the only Master R Developer Workshop Hadley is planning for the US West Coast in 2016.

We look forward to seeing you there!
