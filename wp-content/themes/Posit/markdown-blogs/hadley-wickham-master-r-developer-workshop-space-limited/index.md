Give yourself the gift of "mastering" R to start 2015!

Join RStudio Chief Data Scientist Hadley Wickham at the Westin San Francisco on January 19 and 20 for this rare opportunity to learn from one of the R community's most popular and innovative authors and package developers.

As of this post, the workshop is two-thirds sold out. If you're in or near California and want to boost your R programming skills, this is Hadley's only West Coast public workshop planned for 2015.
