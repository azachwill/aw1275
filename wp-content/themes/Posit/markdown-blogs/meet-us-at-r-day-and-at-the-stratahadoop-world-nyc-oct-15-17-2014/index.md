Are you headed to Strata? It's just around the corner!

We particularly hope to see you at [R Day](http://strataconf.com/stratany2014/public/schedule/detail/37037) on October 15, where we will cover a raft of current topics that analysts and R users need to pay attention to. The R Day tutorials come from Hadley Wickham, Winston Chang, Garrett Grolemund, J.J. Allaire, and Yihui Xie who are all working on fascinating new ways to keep the R ecosystem apace of the challenges facing those who work with data.

If you plan to stay for the full [Strata Conference+Hadoop World](http://strataconf.com/stratany2014?intcmp=il-strata-stny14-franchise-page) be sure to look us up in the Innovator Pavilion booth P14 during the Expo Hall hours. We'll have the latest books from RStudio authors and "shiny" t-shirts to win. Share with us what you're doing with RStudio and get your product and company questions answered by RStudio employees.

See you in New York City!
