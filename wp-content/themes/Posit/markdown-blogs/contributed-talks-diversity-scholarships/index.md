[rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/), the conference on all things R and RStudio, will take place February 2 and 3, 2018 in San Diego, California, preceded by Training Days on January 31 and February 1. We are pleased to announce that this year's conference includes contributed talks and e-posters, and diversity scholarships. <!-- more --> More information below!

## Contributed talks and e-posters

rstudio::conf() is accepting proposals for contributed __talks__ and __e-posters__ for the first time! Contributed talks are 20 minutes long, and will be scheduled alongside talks by RStudio employees and invited speakers. E-posters will be shown during the opening reception on Thursday evening: we’ll provide a big screen, power, and internet; you’ll provide a laptop with an innovative display or demo.  

We are particularly interested in talks and e-posters that:

* Showcase the use of R and RStudio’s tools to solve real problems.

* Expand the tidyverse to reach new domains and audiences.

* Communicate using R, whether it’s building on top of RMarkdown, Shiny, ggplot2, or something else altogether.

* Discuss how to teach R effectively.

To present you’ll also need to register for the conference.

Applications close Sept 15, and you’ll be notified of our decision by Oct 1.

## Diversity scholarships

We’re also continuing our tradition of __diversity scholarships__, and this year we’re doubling the program to twenty recipients. We will support underrepresented minorities in the R community by covering their registration (including workshops), travel, and accommodation.
