Join RStudio at one of our Fall and Winter workshops!  We'll be hosting a few different workshops in a variety of cities across the US and UK. Topics range from building tidy tools, to teaching data science, to mastering machine learning. See below for more details on each workshop and how to register.  

 
### Building Tidy Tools with Hadley Wickham

**When**: October 14 & 15, 2019 

**Where**: Loudermilk Conference Center in Atlanta, GA

**Who**: Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist at RStudio

Chief Data Scientist Hadley Wickham is hosting his popular “Building Tidy Tools” workshop in Atlanta, Georgia this October. 
 
You should take this workshop if you have experience programming in R and want to learn how to tackle larger scale problems. You’ll get the most from it if you’re already familiar with functions and are comfortable with R’s basic data structures (vectors, matrices, arrays, lists, and data frames). Note: There is ~30% overlap in the material with Hadley’s previous “R Masterclass”. However, the material has been substantially reorganized, so if you’ve taken the R Masterclass in the past, you’ll still learn a lot in this class.
 
This course has three primary goals. You will: 
 
1. Learn efficient workflows for developing high-quality R functions, using the set of conventions codified by a package. You'll also learn workflows for unit testing, which helps ensure that your functions do exactly what you think they do. 
 
2. Master the art of writing functions that do one thing well and can be fluently combined together to solve more complex problems. We'll cover common function writing pitfalls and how to avoid them. 
3. Learn how to write collections of functions that work well together and adhere to existing conventions so they're easy to pick up for newcomers. We'll discuss API design, functional programming tools, the basics of object design in S3, and the tidy eval system for NSE. 
 

### Welcome to the Tidyverse: An Introduction to R for Data Science

**When**: The one-day workshop is hosted on both October 14 & October 15 
 
**Where**: Loudermilk Conference Center in Atlanta, GA
 
**Who**:

- Carl Howe, Director of Education at RStudio 
- Christina Koch, University of Wisconsin
- Teon Brooks, Data Scientist at Mozilla
 
Register Here: https://cvent.me/ZlvXL

Join RStudio’s Director of Education, Carl Howe, and some special teachers for their “Welcome to the Tidyverse: An Introduction to R for Data Science”. This workshop is designed for folks who are new to R and want to learn more. 
 
Looking for an effective way to learn R? This one-day course will teach you a workflow for doing data science with the R language. It focuses on using R’s Tidyverse, which is a core set of R packages that are known for their impressive performance and ease of use. We will focus on doing data science, not programming.
 
In this course, you’ll learn to: 
 
1. Visualize data with R's `ggplot2` package 
2. Wrangle data with R's `dplyr` package 
3. Fit models with base R 
4. Document your work reproducibly with R Markdown 
 

### Machine Learning Workshop with Max Kuhn

**When**: November 18 & 19, 2019
 
**Where**: Hilton London Paddington in London, UK
 
**Who**: Max Kuhn , Software Engineer at RStudio 
 
Register here: https://cvent.me/bKoXk
 
See Max Kuhn teach his Machine Learning workshop this fall in London. This is a great chance to hear Max teach and experience this class while he is across the pond. 

This two-day course will provide an overview of using R for supervised learning. The session will step through the process of building, visualizing, testing, and comparing models that are focused on prediction. The goal of the course is to provide a thorough workflow in R that can be used with many different regression or classification techniques. Case studies on real data will be used to illustrate the functionality and several different predictive models are illustrated.
 
### Introduction to Machine Learning with the Tidyverse

**When**: December 12 & 13, 2019 
 
**Where**: RStudio’s Boston Office 
 
**Who**: 

- Garrett Grolemund, Data Scientist and Professional Educator at RStudio
- Alison Hill, Data Scientist and Professional Educator at RStudio
 
Register here: https://cvent.me/brM1M

Get a sneak peek at Garrett and Alison’s rstudio::conf2020 workshop, “Introduction to Machine Learning with the Tidyverse”. If you can’t make it to the conference this year, this is your chance to experience one of the workshops and help them test drive their content. 
 
This is a test run for a workshop in the final stages of development. The workshop provides a gentle introduction to machine learning and to the tidyverse packages that do machine learning. You’ll learn how to train and assess predictive models with several common machine learning algorithms, as well as how to do feature engineering to improve the predictive accuracy of your models. We will focus on learning the basic theory and best practices that support machine learning, and we will do it with a modern suite of R packages known as `tidymodels`. Tidymodels packages, like `parsnip`, `recipes`, and `rsample` provide a grammar for modeling and work seamlessly with R’s tidyverse packages.
 
Since this is a test run, the workshop is limited to a small number of seats. The low price reflects the experimental nature of the material. Students will be asked to provide constructive feedback in a course survey.
