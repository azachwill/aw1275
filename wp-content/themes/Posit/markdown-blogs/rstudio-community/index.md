We’re excited to announce [community.rstudio.com][community], a new site for discussions about RStudio, the tidyverse, and friends. To begin with, we’re focussing on three main areas:

* [The Tidyverse](http://discourse.rstudio.org/c/tidyverse)
* [Shiny](http://discourse.rstudio.org/c/shiny)
* [RStudio IDE](http://discourse.rstudio.org/c/rstudio-ide)

In the near future, we expect to launch a category for RStudio admins. This will be a place to coordinate knowledge about best practices for installing, configuring, and managing RStudio products, and for running R in production. Stay tuned for more details!

## What is communty.rstudio.com for?

It’s easiest to say what community.rstudio.com is not: it’s not a replacement for Stack Overflow, GitHub, or our premium support services:

* If you have a precisely and clearly defined question (and accompanying 
  [reprex][reprex]), you should still ask it on [Stack Overflow][so]. 

* If you have discovered a bug in an R package, you should still file an 
  issue on [GitHub](http://github.com/tidyverse). 

* If you’re a customer with a commercial license for a Professional products, 
  you should continue to report Pro product issues as described in our
  [support agreement](https://www.rstudio.com/about/support-agreement/).

The goal of community.rstudio.com is to provide a [friendly space][guidelines] for discussions that don’t quite fit into the above categories. It’s a great place to send your friends who are intimidated by Stack Overflow, or to go to if you’re not sure whether or not you've found a bug. We expect that it will gradually supplant our existing google groups like shiny-discuss and ggplot2.

RStudio employees will frequent the discussions, but we won’t have time to answer every question. We will ensure that discussions remain [friendly and professional][guidelines], but our goal is to foster an environment where the RStudio community can help one another. 

## Getting the ball rolling

The RStudio forums are a community site, and a community site is nothing without a community! In order to generate some initial momentum, we’re going to be running four limited-time promotions:

* Joe Cheng (developer of Shiny), Hadley Wickham (me), and Garrett Grolemund 
  (RStudio master instructor) will do [weekly office hours][office-hours]. 
  We’ll each be online for at least one hour per week, and will spend that 
  time answering your questions.

* If you post in the first month, you’ll get a custom “founding member” badge 
  for your [community.rstudio.com][community] profile.
  
* Each week for the next month we'll recognize a few of the most helpful 
  participants, and send them a sticker pack and t-shirt. Post once during the 
  week to be eligible.

* Each month for the next six months we’ll select one person who we feel has 
  been particularly helpful to the community, and send them a signed copy of 
  R4DS and an RStudio t-shirt of their choice.  

Depending on how things go, we might keep doing the prize packs for longer, but you should participate soon in order to maximise your chances of a sweet prize!
