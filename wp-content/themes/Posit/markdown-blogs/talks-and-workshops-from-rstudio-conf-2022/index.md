In July, we wrapped up rstudio::conf(2022). Throughout the conference, we had an exciting array of workshops, an inspiring lineup of speakers, Birds of a Feather meetups, sticker drops, and a few surprises — like <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/blog/rstudio-is-becoming-posit/" target = "_blank">RStudio becoming Posit</a> in October 2022! Whether you joined us in person in Washington, D.C., or virtually from around the world, thank you for attending.

We are excited to share the workshop materials and talk recordings from rstudio::conf(2022), linked below:
