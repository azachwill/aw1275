On October 12, RStudio launched [R Views](https://rviews.rstudio.com/) with great enthusiasm. R Views is a new blog for R users [about the R Community and the R Language](https://rviews.rstudio.com/about/). Under the care of editor-in-chief and new RStudio ambassador-at-large, Joseph Rickert, R Views provides a new perspective on R and RStudio that we like to think will become essential reading for you.

You may have read an R Views post already. In the first, widely syndicated, post, [Joseph interviewed J.J. Allaire](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2016/10/12/interview-with-j-j-allaire/), RStudio's founder, CEO and most prolific software developer. Later posts by [Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel on Highcharts](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2016/10/19/creating-interactive-plots-with-r-and-highcharts/) and thoughtful book reviews, new R package picks, and a primer on Naive Bayes from Joseph rounded out the first month. Each post was entirely different from anything you could have read here, on what we now call our Developer Blog at rstudio.org.

Fortunately, you don't have to choose. Each has its purpose. Our Developer Blog is the place to go for RStudio news. You'll find product announcements, events, and company happenings - like the announcement of a new blog - right here. R Views is about R in action. You'll find stories and solutions and opinions that we hope will educate and challenge you.

Subscribe to each and stay up to date on all things R and RStudio!

Thanks for making R and RStudio part of your data science experience and for supporting our work.
