You will learn from Garrett Grolemund, Yihui Xie, and Nathan Stephens who are all working on fascinating new ways to keep the R ecosystem apace of the challenges facing those who work with data.

Topics include:

If you plan to stay for the full Strata Conference+Hadoop World be sure to look us up at booth 633 during the Expo Hall hours. We'll have the latest books from RStudio authors and "shiny" t-shirts to win. Share with us what you're doing with RStudio and get your product and company questions answered by RStudio employees.
