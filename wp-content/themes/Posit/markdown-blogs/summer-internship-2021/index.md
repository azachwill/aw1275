We are excited to announce the fourth formal summer internship program at RStudio. The goal of our internship program is to enable RStudio employees to collaborate with current students to do impactful work that not only helps both RStudio users and the broader community, but ensures that the community of R developers is just as diverse as its community of users. Over the course of the internship, you will work with experienced data scientists, software developers, and educators to create and share new tools and ideas.

The internship pays up to $12,000 USD (paid hourly) and will last 10-12 weeks. The start date is May 24th–June 7th, depending on your availability (applications are open now, and this year there is no application deadline). To qualify, you must currently be a student (broadly construed - if you think you’re a student, you probably qualify) and have some experience writing code in R and using Git and GitHub. To demonstrate these skills, your application needs to include a link to a package, Shiny app, or data analysis repository on GitHub. It’s OK if you create something specifically for this application: we just need to know that you’re already familiar with the mechanics of collaborative development in R.

RStudio is a geographically distributed team which means you can be based anywhere in the United States (we hope to expand the program to support in other countries in the future). This year you will be working 100% remotely and you will meet with your mentor regularly online.



We are recruiting interns for the following projects:

## Tidyverse

**shinymodels** - The tidymodels framework is a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles. The goal of this internship is to create a package that, given a tidymodels object, will launch a Shiny application.<br>
*Mentor: Max Kuhn*
 
 
 
**Polishing cpp11** - Improve the [`cpp11` package]( https://cpp11.r-lib.org/). The `cpp11` package provides C++ bindings to R code. This intern will work to improve the package by adding functionality, fixing bugs, and writing documentation, including introductory tutorials, how-to guides and in-depth explanatory vignettes.<br>
*Supervisor: Jim Hester*
 
 
## Education

**Cheat Sheets** - Enhance [RStudio's cheat sheet gallery](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). Primary tasks will be to review and update existing cheat sheets to reflect new package features, to create new cheat sheets, and to streamline the intake of community contributed cheat sheets. <br>
*Mentors: Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Garrett Grolemund.*

**Exercise Content** - Develop practice content for R users. Primary tasks will be to write exercises with the [`learnr`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) formats, to write grading checks with [`gradethis`](https://rstudio-education.github.io/gradethis/), to organize exercises in a git repository, and to identify and clean example datasets for R learners. <br>
*Mentor: Garrett Grolemund.*

**Automate grading of R Markdown assignments** - The intern will work on extending `gradethis` with a suite of tools for educators to orchestrate automated feedback of student assignments written in R Markdown documents. <br>
*Mentor: Garrick Aden-Buie.*


## R Markdown

This intern will work with the R Markdown team on our ecosystem of R packages for data science communication built on Pandoc. You'll contribute actively to our software development process as we work to improve our toolchain for academic, scientific, and technical publishing.<br>
*Mentor: Alison Hill*

## Marketing

Help share data science customer stories: Customer stories and conversations are a critical source of information, both for the data science community and for product teams, and RStudio has many such conversations with our customers. <br>
*Mentor: Lou Bajuk*
