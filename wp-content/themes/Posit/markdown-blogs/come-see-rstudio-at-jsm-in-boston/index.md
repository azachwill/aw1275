For even more talks on R we thought Joseph Rickert's "Data Scientists and R Users Guide to the JSM" was excellent. Click here to see it. http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/07/a-data-scientists-and-r-users-guide-to-the-jsm.html

While you're at the conference, please come by our exhibition area (Booth #112) to say hello. J.J., Hadley and other members of the team will be there. We've got enough space to talk about your plans for R and how RStudio Server Pro and Shiny Server Pro can provide enterprise-ready support and scalability for your RStudio IDE and Shiny Server deployments.

We hope to see you there!
