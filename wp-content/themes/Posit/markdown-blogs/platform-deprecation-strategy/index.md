In an effort to streamline product development, maintenance, and support to ensure the best experience for our users, we have created a strategy for operating system and browser deprecation. This will allow us to focus our work on modern platforms, and to encourage best practices in R development.

This policy applies to all of our products and packages, and has been posted to the website [here](https://www.rstudio.com/about/platform-deprecation-strategy/). This strategy is included in our Support Agreement, the full text of which can be found [here](https://www.rstudio.com/about/support-agreement/). 

The current support end dates have been chosen based on the OS or browser end-of-life dates, and are generally aligned with the dates on which the latest version of R can no longer be installed on them. Note that the first deprecation takes place on April 2, 2018, when Internet Explorer 10 and Ubuntu 12.04 will no longer be supported on new releases of our software.
