RStudio appreciates the hundreds of smart, passionate, data science enthusiasts who have already registered for [rstudio::conf 2018](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/). We’re looking forward to a fantastic conference, immersing in all things R & RStudio.

If you haven’t registered yet, please do! Some workshops are now full. We are also over **90% of our registration target** - with more than 2 months to go. It’s safe to say we will sell out. The sooner you are able to register, the better. It’s going to be an amazing time!

**[REGISTER TODAY](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/rstudioconf-tickets/)**

For those who have registered, we’d like to help you connect with others doing similar work. 

Attendees include many kinds of professionals in physical, natural, social and data sciences, statistics, education, engineering, research, BI, IT data infrastructure, finance, marketing, customer support, operations, human resources...and many more. They are sole proprietors and work for the world’s largest companies. They live in developing and developed countries. They use R and RStudio to explore data, develop polished reports, publish interactive visualizations, or create production code central to the success of their company. They share a common bond - a commitment to R, enthusiasm for RStudio products, and a desire to become better data scientists.

To foster relationships among people doing similar work we’ve made time and arranged spaces for 9 total Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions.They will be held during breakfast and lunch, so you can grab a meal and head to your preferred BoF room!

Some topics seem obvious to us. For example, we will definitely set aside rooms for Life Sciences, Financial Services, Education, and Training & Consulting Partner BoFs. As we see it, a BoF is just a short unconference session within a conference, organized or left un-organized (mostly) by participants! Topics may be narrow or broad. Some may have agendas and others may be purely for networking. At a minimum, each room will have a friendly RStudio proctor, chairs, a screen to present, and flipcharts for those who are inspired to create discussion sub-groups, share material broadly, or collaborate.

**What Birds of a Feather sessions would you like to attend?**

In addition to the 4 BoFs we will set aside rooms for, we’re going to use the new [community.rstudio.com](https://community.rstudio.com/) as a place to discuss which 5 additional BoFs should be allocated time and space. If you are registered for rstudio::conf or planning to register, head on over and look for the rstudio::conf category and the "your ideas for birds of a feather sessions" topic to start proposing and upvoting!

Once the BoF session topics are decided, we’ll load them into our mobile app for the conference. This, along with community.rstudio.com, will allow for Pre-BoF discussions so you can hit the ground running in San Diego!
