![Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/devtools-cheatsheet.png)

We've added a new cheatsheet to our [collection](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)! _Package Development with devtools_ will help you find the most useful functions for building packages in R. The cheatsheet will walk you through the steps of building a package from:

  * Setting up the package structure

  * Adding a DESCRIPTION file

  * Writing code

  * Writing tests

  * Writing documentation with roxygen

  * Adding data sets

  * Building a NAMESPACE, and

  * Including vignettes

The sheet focuses on Hadley Wickham's devtools package, and it is a useful supplement to Hadley's book _R Packages_, which you can read online at [r-pkgs.had.co.nz](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz).

Download the sheet [here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

**Bonus** - Vivian Zhang of [SupStat Analytics](http://supstat.com) has kindly translated the existing Data Wrangling, R Markdown, and Shiny cheatsheets into Chinese. You can download the translations at the bottom of the [cheatsheet gallery](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).
