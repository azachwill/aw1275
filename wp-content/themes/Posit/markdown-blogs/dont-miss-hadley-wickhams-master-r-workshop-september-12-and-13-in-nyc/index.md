New York City is a wonderful place to be most of the time but especially in September!

If you live or work in the city or just want a good business reason to visit, consider joining RStudio Chief Data Scientist Hadley Wickham in the heart of Manhattan on September 12th and 13th, just by Times Square at the [AMA Conference Center](http://www.amaconferencecenter.org/new-york.htm). It's a rare opportunity to learn from one of the R community's most popular and innovative authors and package developers.

Hadley's workshops usually sell out. This is his only East US public workshop in 2016 and there are no plans to do another in NYC in 2017. If you're an active R user and have been meaning to take this class, now is the perfect time to do it!

We look forward to seeing you in New York!
