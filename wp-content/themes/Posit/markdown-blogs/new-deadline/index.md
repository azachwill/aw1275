The call for talks at [rstudio::conf(2022)](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) has been extended to March 28!

We'd love to hear about:

-   How you've used R (by itself or with other tools) to solve a challenging problem.
-   Projects and teams where R and Python live together in harmony.
-   Your favorite R package and how it makes life easier or unlocks new capabilities.
-   Your techniques for teaching data science to help reach new domains and new audiences.
-   Your broad reflections on data science, packages, code, and community.
-   Anything else you think the RStudio community would love to hear about!

## What do talks look like?

Talks are 20 minutes long and can be either live and in-person or pre-recorded and remote.
If you're interested in giving a pre-recorded talk, it doesn't need to be in English.

As the shape of the event becomes more clear, we may expand the program to include pre-recorded lightning talks.
If this happens, lightning talks will be drawn from the main pool of talk proposals, i.e. there is no separate application process.

## Why give a talk?

-   All speakers will receive coaching from [Articulation Inc](https://www.articulationinc.com/). Speakers for rstudio::global(2021) found the coaching both fun and very worthwhile; it's a great opportunity to polish your speaking skills while getting to know the other speakers.
-   You'll get free registration to the conference.
-   We don't have all the details yet, but we will have some travel support available for those who need it.

## How do I submit?

To submit a talk, you'll need to create a 60 second video that introduces you and your proposed topic.
In the video, you should tell us who you are, why your topic is important, and what attendees will take away from it.
If you're worried about creating a video, Jesse Mostipak put together a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/kierisi/status/1503781247461560334) with a bunch of advice.
One tip: if you've spent a bunch of time on Zoom, Google Meet, etc during the pandemic, an easy way to create your video is to just meet with yourself and record it!

If you're interested, please submit a proposal at: <https://rstd.io/conf-talks-2022>.
