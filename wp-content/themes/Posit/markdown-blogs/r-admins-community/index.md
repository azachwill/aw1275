Today we're pleased to announce a new category of community.rstudio.com dedicated to R administrators: <https://community.rstudio.com/c/r-admin>. 

There are already multiple places where you can get help with R, Shiny, the RStudio IDE, and the tidyverse. There are, however, far fewer resources for R admins: people who work with R in production, in large organizations, and in complex environments. We hope this new category will serve as a useful and friendly place to connect with fellow R admins to discuss the issues they deal with. We expect this category to include:

* Discussions about best practices and ideas

* General questions to fellow admins about RStudio Pro products, designed to ease friction in R administrator workflows

* An exchange of ideas on domain-specific use cases and configurations

If you’re an existing RStudio customer, this forum is a complement to RStudio’s direct support:

* Folks from RStudio will participate, but only lightly moderate topics and discussions.

* RStudio commercial license holders should still feel free to report Pro 
  product problems to <support@rstudio.com>.

* If you think a topic needs RStudio support’s attention, please suggest that 
  the poster contact RStudio support directly. You can also tag @support in a reply.
