We've added a new cheatsheet to our [collection](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). _Data Visualization with ggplot2_ describes how to build a plot with ggplot2 and the grammar of graphics. You will find helpful reminders of how to use:

  * geoms

  * stats

  * scales

  * coordinate systems

  * facets

  * position adjustments

  * legends, and

  * themes

The cheatsheet also documents tips on zooming.

Download the cheatsheet [here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

**Bonus** - Frans van Dunn√© of [Innovate Online](http://innovateonline.nl/) has provided Spanish translations of the Data Wrangling, R Markdown, Shiny, and Package Development cheatsheets. Download them at the bottom of the [cheatsheet gallery](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).
