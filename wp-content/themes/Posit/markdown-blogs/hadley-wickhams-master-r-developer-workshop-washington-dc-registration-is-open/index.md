"Master" R in Washington DC this September!

Join RStudio Chief Data Scientist Hadley Wickham at the AMA â€“ Executive Conference Center in Arlington, VA on September 14 and 15, 2015 for this rare opportunity to learn from one of the R community's most popular and innovative authors and package developers.

It will be at least another year before Hadley returns to teach his class on the East Coast, so don't miss this opportunity to learn from him in person. The venue is conveniently located next to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and a short distance from the Metro. Attendance is limited. Past events have sold out.
