Have you embraced the tidyverse? Do you now want to expand it to meet your needs? Then this is a NEW two-day hands on workshop designed for you! The goal of this workshop is to take you from someone who uses tidyverse functions to someone who can extend the tidyverse by:

- Writing expressive code using advanced functional programming techniques
- Designs consistent APIs using analogies to existing tools
- Uses the S3 object system to make user friendly values
- Can bundle functions with documentation and tests into a package to share with others.

The class is taught by Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist at RStudio, a member of the R Foundation, and Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and the University of Auckland. He builds tools (both computational and cognitive) to make data science easier, faster, and more fun. Much of the material for the course is drawn from two of his existing books, [Advanced R](http://adv-r.hadley.nz/) and [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz), but the course also includes a lot of new material that will eventually become a book called "Tidy tools".

As of today, there are just 30+ seats left. Discounts are still available for academics (students or faculty) and for 5 or more attendees from any organization. Email training@rstudio.com if you have any questions about the workshop that you don't find answered on the registration page.
