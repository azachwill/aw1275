The tidyverse is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share common data representations and API design. The **tidyverse** package is designed to make it easy to install and load core packages from the tidyverse in a single command.

The best place to learn about all the packages in the tidyverse and how they fit together is [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). Expect to hear more about the tidyverse in the coming months as I work on improved package websites, making [citation easier](http://joss.theoj.org/), and providing a common home for discussions about data analysis with the tidyverse.

## Installation

You can install tidyverse with

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

This will install the core tidyverse packages that you are likely to use in almost every analysis:

  * [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/), for data visualisation.

  * [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr), for data manipulation.

  * [tidyr](https://github.com/hadley/tidyr), for data tidying.

  * [readr](https://github.com/hadley/readr), for data import.

  * [purrr](https://github.com/hadley/purrr), for functional programming.

  * [tibble](https://github.com/hadley/tibble), for tibbles, a modern re-imagining of data frames.

It also installs a selection of other tidyverse packages that you're likely to use frequently, but probably not in every analysis. This includes packages for data manipulation:

  * [hms](https://github.com/krlmlr/hms), for times.

  * [stringr](https://github.com/hadley/stringr), for strings.

  * [lubridate](https://github.com/hadley/lubridate), for date/times.

  * [forcats](https://hadley.github.io/forcats/), for factors.

Data import:

  * [DBI](https://github.com/rstats-db/DBI), for databases.

  * [haven](https://github.com/hadley/haven/), for SPSS, SAS and Stata files.

  * [httr](https://github.com/hadley/httr/), for web apis.

  * [jsonlite](https://github.com/jeroenooms/jsonlite) for JSON.

  * [readxl](https://github.com/hadley/readxl), for `.xls` and `.xlsx` files.

  * [rvest](https://github.com/hadley/rvest), for web scraping.

  * [xml2](https://github.com/hadley/xml2), for XML.

And modelling:

  * [modelr](https://github.com/hadley/modelr), for simple modelling within a pipeline

  * [broom](https://github.com/dgrtwo/broom), for turning models into tidy data

These packages will be installed along with tidyverse, but you'll load them explicitly with `library()`.

## Usage

`library(tidyverse)` will load the core tidyverse packages: ggplot2, tibble, tidyr, readr, purrr, and dplyr. You also get a condensed summary of conflicts with other packages you have loaded:

```r
library(tidyverse)
#> Loading tidyverse: ggplot2
#> Loading tidyverse: tibble
#> Loading tidyverse: tidyr
#> Loading tidyverse: readr
#> Loading tidyverse: purrr
#> Loading tidyverse: dplyr
#> Conflicts with tidy packages ---------------------------------------
#> filter(): dplyr, stats
#> lag():    dplyr, stats
```

You can see conflicts created later with `tidyverse_conflicts()`:

```r
library(MASS)
#>
#> Attaching package: 'MASS'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':
#>
#>     select
tidyverse_conflicts()
#> Conflicts with tidy packages --------------------------------------
#> filter(): dplyr, stats
#> lag():    dplyr, stats
#> select(): dplyr, MASS
```

And you can check that all tidyverse packages are up-to-date with `tidyverse_update()`:

```r
tidyverse_update()
#> The following packages are out of date:
#>  * broom (0.4.0 -> 0.4.1)
#>  * DBI   (0.4.1 -> 0.5)
#>  * Rcpp  (0.12.6 -> 0.12.7)
#> Update now?
#>
#> 1: Yes
#> 2: No
```
