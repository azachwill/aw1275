description: Three key attributes define Serious Data Science; open-source software, code-first development, and a centralized data science infrastructure. This approach has been successful at driving value and impact at hundreds of organizations. In this post, we will focus on the advantages of code-first data science.

RStudio has worked with hundreds of different data science teams, and we've seen three key strategies that help maximize their productivity and impact:

* Adopting open source as the core of their work
* Leading with a Code-First approach
* Implementing a centralized data science infrastructure

Collectively, we call this approach <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/solutions/serious-data-science/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Serious Data Science</a>. In this post, we focus on the benefits of a Code-First approach.

A no-code approach to data science has some serious drawbacks, as described in this video:

As we discussed in depth <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/why-your-enterprise-needs-code-first-data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a recent webinar</a>, a Code-First approach is important because:

* Code provides the flexibility to build and share the most valuable insights, tailored to the analytic problems and needs of your stakeholders
* Code enables fast iteration and updates
* Code by its nature is reusable, extensible, and inspectable

Code-First helps overcome the pitfalls of no-code approaches, as shown in the table below:

<table class="table-striped-odd-bg">
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="problem"> No-Code Problem </th>
    <th class="solution"> Code-First Solution </th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Difficulty in tracking changes and auditing work</p></td>
    <td>
      <p>Code, coupled with version control systems like git, can track what changed, when, by whom, and why.</p>
      <p>Code can be logged when run for auditing and monitoring.</p>
    </td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>No single source of truth</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>Centralized tools can create a single source of truth for data, dashboards, and models.</p>
      <p>Version control can track multiple versions of code separately without creating conflicts.</p>
    </td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Difficulty in reproducing and extending work</p></td>
    <td>
    <p>Code can enable reproducibility by explicitly recording every step taken.</p>
    <p>Open-source code can be deployed on many platforms and is not dependent on proprietary tools.</p>
    <p>Code can be copied, pasted, and modified to address emergent problems as circumstances change.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Limitations on analysis techniques and presentation formats</p></td>
    <td><p>Code can allow you to analyze and present all your data as you need to in the form of custom dashboards and reports.</p>
<p>Code can pull in new methods and open-source work without waiting for vendors to add proprietary features.</p></td>
  </tr>
