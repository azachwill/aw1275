RStudio will teach the new essentials for doing data science in R at this year's [Strata NYC conference](http://strataconf.com/stratany2014/public/schedule/detail/37037), Oct 15 2014.

R Day at Strata is a full day of tutorials that will cover some of the most useful topics in R. You'll learn how to manipulate and visualize data with R, as well as how to write reproducible, interactive reports that foster collaboration. Topics include:

9:00am – 10:30am
A Grammar of Data Manipulation with dplyr
Speaker: Hadley Wickham

11:00am – 12:30pm
A Reactive Grammar of Graphics with ggvis
Speaker: Winston Chang

1:30pm – 3:00pm
Analytic Web Applications with Shiny
Speaker: Garrett Grolemund

3:30pm – 5:00pm
Reproducible R Reports with Packrat and Rmarkdown
Speaker: JJ Allaire & Yihui Xie

The tutorials are integrated into a cohesive day of instruction. Many of the tools that we'll cover did not exist six months ago, so you are almost certain to learn something new. You will get the most out of the day if you already know how to load data into R and have some basic experience visualizing and manipulating data.
