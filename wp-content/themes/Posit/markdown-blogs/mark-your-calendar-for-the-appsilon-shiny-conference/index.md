We’re excited to team up with our Full Service Partner, <a href="https://appsilon.com/" target = "_blank">Appsilon</a>, as they host their first virtual <a href="https://appsilon.com/2022-appsilon-shiny-conference/" target = "_blank">Shiny conference</a>.

## What should I expect?

Three days of free, online Shiny content ranging from tips and tricks from the experts, to fascinating community case studies, and examples of enterprise scaling solutions. 

Live presentations are scheduled to overlap appropriate business hours for time zones across Europe, Africa, and the Americas (Start: April 27th, 11:00 CEST/05:00 CDT, End: April 29th, 19:00 CEST/13:00 CDT). 

Our own Joe Cheng and Winston Chang will be joining the keynote panel to answer your questions and discuss what they’re most excited about on the Shiny horizon. They’ll be chatting with Appsilon’s CEO, Filip Stachura, and the panel will be moderated by Eric Nantz, who you may recognize from the <a href="https://shinydevseries.com/" target = "_blank">Shiny Developer Series</a>. 

The panelists will be taking live questions from the audience using slido. Drop in to ask your question and upvote others. The goal is to facilitate a lively conversation that speaks to the wider Shiny community, and everyone is encouraged to participate, regardless of level of experience.
