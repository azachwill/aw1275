Today we're excited to announce the general release of RStudio 1.3. This release features many major improvements to the IDE, including:

- Dramatically improved **accessibility** for sight-impaired users, which also upgrades keyboard navigation, contrast ratios, and visibility for everyone.
- A real-time **spell-checking engine**, with suggestions, customizable dictionaries, and a built-in whitelist for common data science terms.
- Extensible, in-IDE **tutorials** powered by the [`learnr` package](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/).
- **Settings and preferences** are now stored in plain text files you can back up or manage with other tools; they can also be applied globally to all users on an RStudio Server.
- Improved compatibility with **R 4.0** and **iPad OS 13.1**.
- Many improvements to **RStudio Server security**, including idle timeouts and hardening against common types of attacks.
- Dozens of small productivity improvements, including **autosave**, **global replace**, **customizable file templates**, **Shiny jobs**, and more.

If you've purchased the Professional version of RStudio, this release also has some new capabilities for you:

- **RStudio Desktop Pro** can now function as a client for RStudio Server Pro; run your R session on your server with the convenience of native desktop windows and menus. 
- A new **user manager** on the Admin Dashboard makes it easy to manage licensed users on RStudio Server Pro.
- Many small improvements to the **Kubnernetes** and **Slurm** Job Launcher plugins.
