[rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/), the conference on all things R and RStudio, will take place January 17 and 18, 2019 in Austin, Texas, preceded by Training Days on January 15 and 16.

We've received requests from a number of you for permission to submit talk/e-poster abstracts after the deadline (this Saturday, September 15). In response, we're extending the deadline by a week for everyone; **the new submission deadline is September 22,** a week from Saturday. We'll still notify you of our decision on October 1.

See our [earlier post](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/08/20/rstudio-conf-2019-contributed-talks-eposters/) for submission guidelines.
