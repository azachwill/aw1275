The [JSM conference](https://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2016/) in Chicago, July 31 thru August 4, 2016, is one of the largest to be found on statistics, with many terrific talks for R users. We've listed some of the sessions that we're particularly excited about below. These include talks from RStudio employees, like Hadley Wickham, Yihui Xie, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, Garrett Grolemund, and Joe Cheng, but also include a bunch of other talks about R that we think look interesting.

When you're not in one of the sessions below, please visit us in the exhibition area, booth #126-128. We'll have copies of all our [cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) and [stickers](https://www.rstudio.com/about/gear/), and it's a great place to learn about the other stuff we've been working on lately:  from [Sparklyr](https://spark.rstudio.com/) and [R Markdown Notebooks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html) to the latest in [RStudio Server Pro](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-server-pro/), [Shiny Server Pro](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny-server-pro/), [shinyapps.io](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shinyapps/), [RStudio Connect (beta)](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) and [more](https://www.rstudio.com/about/news-events/)!

Another great place to chat with people interested in R is the Statistical Computing and Graphics Mixer at 6pm on Monday in the Hilton Stevens Salon A4. It's advertised as a business meeting in the program, but don't let that put you off - it's open to all.
