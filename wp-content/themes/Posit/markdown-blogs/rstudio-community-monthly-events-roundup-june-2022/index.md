## Recurring Events

### Data Science Hangout

The Data Science Hangout is a weekly, free-to-join open conversation for current and aspiring data science leaders to connect and chat about some of the more human-centric questions around data science leadership. These happen every Thursday at 12 ET with a different leader featured each week.

The conversation is all audience-based and you can jump on whenever it fits your schedule. Add the weekly hangouts <a href="https://www.addevent.com/event/Qv9211919" target = "_blank">to your calendar</a> and check out the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/data-science-hangout/" target = "_blank">website</a> with all the recordings.

A few other things:

* All are welcome - no matter your industry/experience
* No need to register for anything
* It's always okay to join for part of a session
* You can just listen-in if you want
* You can ask anonymous questions too!

### RStudio Enterprise Community Meetups
