This past January, we held the first ever Shiny Developer Conference. It was a chance to gather together a group of intermediate to advanced Shiny users, and take their skills to the next level.

It was an exciting event for me in particular, as I've been dying to share some of these intermediate and advanced Shiny concepts for years now. There are many concepts that aren't strictly required to be productive with Shiny, but make a huge difference in helping you write efficient, robust, maintainable appsâ€”and also make Shiny app authoring a lot more satisfying.

The feedback we received from conference attendees was overwhelmingly positive: everyone from relative novices to the most advanced users told us they gained new insights into how to improve their Shiny apps, or had a perspective shift on concepts they thought they already understood. The user-contributed lightning talks were also a big hit, helping people see what's possible using Shiny and inspiring them to push their own apps further.

If you weren't able to attend but are still interested in building your Shiny skills, we're happy to announce the availability of videos of the tutorials and talks:

At the moment, these videos are our best sources of info on the topics of reactive programming, Shiny gadgets, Shiny modules, debugging Shiny apps, and performance. If you're at all serious about writing Shiny apps, we highly recommend you take the time to watch!
