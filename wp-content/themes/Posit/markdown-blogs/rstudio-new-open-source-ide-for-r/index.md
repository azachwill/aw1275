[RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org/) is a new open-source IDE for R which we're excited to announce the availability of today. RStudio has interesting features for both new and experienced R developers including code completion, execute from source, searchable history, and support for authoring Sweave documents.

RStudio runs on all major desktop platforms (Windows, Mac OS X, Ubuntu, or Fedora) and can also run as a server which enables multiple users to access the IDE using a web browser.

The version of RStudio available today is a beta (v0.92) and is released under the GNU AGPL license. We're hoping for lots of input and dialog with the R community to help make the product as good as it can be!
