We have many great videos on the RStudio YouTube channel. You can watch folks discuss <a href="https://youtu.be/E887K1au5ug" target = "_blank">their data science stories and processes</a>, learn about <a href="https://youtu.be/5gqksthQ0cM" target = "_blank">packages</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/_XNKSEQTo30" target = "_blank">products</a>, and hear <a href="https://youtu.be/IkqItgPSPro" target = "_blank">inspiring examples from others in the community</a>.

With hundreds of videos, you have hours of content to watch! To get you started, we want to highlight three videos about R tools that will take your R skills to another level, whether for work, fun, or general learning. Happy watching!

**1. Business Reports with R Markdown by Christophe Dervieux**

Want to learn how to style your R Markdown reports to tailor them for your organization? Christophe Dervieux shows us various options to customize our HTML output:

* **Using R Markdown’s built-in support for Sass:** R Markdown now has built-in support for Sass through the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/sass/" target = "_blank">sass</a> R package. Sass is a CSS extension language that helps create CSS rules in more flexible ways than with plain CSS. You can directly supply .scss files to `css` arguments of your html document. It’s easier to work with CSS rules and variables to apply your style guidelines.
* **Going further with bslib:** The <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/" target = "_blank">bslib</a> package provides tools for customizing Bootstrap themes directly from R. R Markdown’s built-in support allows you to customize your documents without CSS or Sass. You can start with pre-packaged themes or create a custom look.

Christophe also discusses how to develop templates for Office outputs, create PDFs from HTML using the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown" target = "_blank">pagedown</a> R package, and more.  Watch Christophe’s full talk here:

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis by Priyanka Gagneja**

Exploratory data analysis, or EDA, is a crucial step of every data science project. However, it can be repetitive and time-consuming.

Priyanka Gagneja shares packages that have helped her automate her EDA process. She walks through:

* **Starting your EDA, feature engineering, and data reporting** using <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DataExplorer/vignettes/dataexplorer-intro.html" target = "_blank">DataExplorer</a>.
* **Checking data quality** with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataReporter/index.html" target = "_blank">DataReporter</a>.
* **Calculating summary statistics** using <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/skimr/vignettes/skimr.html" target = "_blank">skimr</a>.

Once you have completed your EDA, then it’s time to start looking at patterns and relationships. Priyanka demonstrates:

* **Creating pipeable pivot tables** using <a href="https://rdrr.io/cran/rpivotTable/man/rpivotTable.html" target = "_blank">rPivotTable</a>.
* **Visualizing your data** with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/esquisse/vignettes/get-started.html" target = "_blank">esquisse</a>.
* **Generating plots and reports** with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/chronicle/index.html" target = "_blank">chronicle</a>.

**3. Scaling Spreadsheets with R by Nathan Stephens**

We use Excel spreadsheets for the same reasons we use R: to wrangle, transform, analyze, visualize, and communicate our data. However, it can be difficult to work in Excel if your data is large or your analysis is complicated. R, however, is an attractive alternative:

* **Increasing file size:** While you start hitting the limits of Excel when you move into gigabytes of data, R can handle those files very easily.
* **Handling complexity:** Things quickly become complicated in Excel with Visual Basic scripts, various pivot tables, multiple spreadsheets, and so on. These can often be replaced by a simple R script.

When would you start to think about using R rather than Excel? Nathan Stephens shows us that boundary where you might agree that R is the right tool for the job.
