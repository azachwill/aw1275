The original deadline for Shiny Contest 2020 was this week, but given that many of us have had lots of unexpected changes to our schedules over the last week due to the COVID-19 outbreak, we have decided to extend the deadline by two weeks. If you've been planning to submit an entry for the contest this week (and if history is any indicator, there may be a few of you out there), please feel free to take this additional time. The new deadline for the contest is 3 April 2020 at 5pm ET.
