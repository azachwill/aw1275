There's been lots of excitement about the new [R Markdown](http://www.rstudio.org/docs/authoring/using_markdown) feature introduced as part of knitr 0.5 and RStudio 0.96. People see R Markdown as both a simpler way to do reproducible research and as a great way to publish to the web from R. Jeromy Anglim has a nice write up on [getting started with R Markdown](http://jeromyanglim.blogspot.com.au/2012/05/getting-started-with-r-markdown-knitr.html) and Marcus Gesmann describes how to [embed Google Visualizations](http://lamages.blogspot.com.au/2012/05/interactive-reports-in-r-with-knitr-and.html) using his googleVis package.

We are just as excited about R Markdown and think there is lots more that can be done with it. We'll be talking about this along with Yihui Xie (author of knitr) and Jeff Horner (author of R/Apache and Rook) on Tuesday June 5th in New York:

At the meetup we'll be showing the latest versions of knitr and RStudio and will be announcing some new R Markdown stuffâ€”if you are in New York we'd love to see you there!
