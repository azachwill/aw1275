We've added two new features that make it easier to learn Shiny with the [Shiny Dev Center](https://shiny.rstudio.com).

  1. **Disqus comments** - Each lesson and article on the Dev Center now has its own comments section. Use the comments section to start a discussion or to leave feedback about the articles.

  2. **How to get help with Shiny** - We've added a new article, [How to get help with Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/help.html), which explains the best ways to get help with Shiny and R. As an open source language, R doesn't have a paid support team, which makes getting help with R (and Shiny) a little different than for paid software.

Are you curious about the Shiny Dev Center? The Dev Center is located at [shiny.rstudio.com](https://shiny.rstudio.com), a central repository of information on Shiny. At the Dev Center, you will find a [tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/), [documentation](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/), [articles](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/) on Shiny, and [example Shiny apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/).
