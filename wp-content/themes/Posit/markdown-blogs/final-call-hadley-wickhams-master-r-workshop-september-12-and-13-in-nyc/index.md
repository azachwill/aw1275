Want to Master R?  There's no better time or place if you're within an easy train, plane, automobile ride or a short jog of Hadley Wickham's workshop on September 12th and 13th at the [AMA Conference Center](http://www.amaconferencecenter.org/new-york.htm) in New York City.

Register here: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/master-r-developer-workshop-new-york-city-tickets-21347014495

As of today, there are just 20+ seats left. Discounts are still available for academics (students or faculty) and for 5 or more attendees from any organization. Email training@rstudio.com if you have any questions about the workshop that you don't find answered on the registration page.

Hadley has no Master R workshops planned for Boston, Washington DC, New York City or any location in the Northeast in the next year. If you've always wanted to take Master R but haven't found the time, well, there's truly no better time!

P.S. We've arranged a "happy hour" reception after class on Monday the 12th. Be sure to set aside an hour or so after the first day to talk to your classmates and Hadley about what's happening in R.
