If you're a data wrangler or data scientist, [ODSC East](http://www.odsc.com/boston/) in Boston from May 20-22 is a wonderful opportunity to get up-to-date on the latest open source tools and trends. R and RStudio will have a significant presence.

**J.J. Allaire**, RStudio founder and CEO, will talk about recent and upcoming improvements in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

The creator of Shiny and CTO of RStudio,** Joe Cheng**, will review the progress made bridging modern web browsers and R, along with the newest updates to [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) and [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) frameworks. In addition, Joe will join **[Zev Ross Spatial Analysis](http://www.zevross.com/)** to offer a Shiny developer workshop for those interested in a deeper dive.

Other notable R speakers include **Max Kuhn**, the author of the Caret package for machine learning and **Jared Lander**, R contributor and author of R for Everyone.

For RStudio and R enthusiasts, ODSC has graciously offered [discounted tickets](https://odsceast.eventbrite.com/?discount=odsc-rs).

We hope to see you there!
