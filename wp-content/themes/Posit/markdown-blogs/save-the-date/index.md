rstudio::conf(2022) is coming July 25-28 to National Harbor, DC!
We'll have more soon on our amazing keynote speakers, our line up of tutorials, our diversity scholarships program, and what we'll be doing to keep y'all safe.
For now, please put the date in your calendar, and read on if you're interested in submitting a talk

## Call for talks

The call for talks at rstudio::conf(2022) is now open!
We'd love to hear about:

-   How you've used R (by itself or with other tools) to solve a challenging problem.
-   Projects and teams where R and Python live together in harmony.
-   Your favorite R package and how it makes life easier or unlocks new capabilities.
-   Your techniques for teaching data scienceÂ  to help reach new domains and new audiences.
-   Your broad reflections on data science, packages, code, and community.
-   Anything else you think the RStudio community would love to hear about!

Talks are 20 minutes long and, while we hope that as many speakers as possible can make it in-person, we understand how much uncertainty the pandemic brings.
Our submission form asks you to indicate your current plans regarding in-person attendance and, in general, we will plan for the reality that some speakers will need to present via a pre-recorded talk.

As the shape of the event becomes more clear, we may expand the program to include pre-recorded lightning talks.
If this happens, lightning talks will be drawn from the main pool of talk proposals, i.e. there is no separate application process.
Speakers receive complimentary registration for the conference (and, budget allowing, needs-based assistance for accommodation and travel).

All speakers will receive coaching from [Articulation Inc](https://www.articulationinc.com/).
This means your past speaking experience isn't as important as the quality of your ideas: if you have an interesting topic, we encourage you to apply, regardless of your background, experience, or job title.
Speakers for rstudio::global(2021) found the coaching both fun and very worthwhile; it's a great opportunity to polish your speaking skills while getting to know the other speakers.

To submit a talk, you'll need to create a 60 second video that introduces you and your proposed topic.
In the video, you should tell us who you are, why your topic is important, and what attendees will take away from it.
If you're interested, please submit a proposal at: <https://rstd.io/conf-talks-2022>.
~~Submission closes March 14, and we'll communicate decisions no later than mid-April.~~

**We've extended the submission deadline! Proposals now due March 28.**
