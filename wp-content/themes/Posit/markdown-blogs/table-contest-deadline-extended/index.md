The original deadline for the [2020 Table Contest](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/announcing-the-2020-rstudio-table/) was scheduled for October 31, 2020.

We know you've been busy and that's okay. Because we've had a number of requests for extensions — including some interest in summarizing election data — the deadline has been extended by two weeks to November 14, 2020.

If you have already submitted an entry, you are free to update it up to the closing date. Find all [table contest submissions on RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/tag/table-contest).
