R Markdown is a framework for writing versatile, reproducible reports from R. With R Markdown, you write a simple plain text report and then render it to create polished output. You can:

  1. Transform your file into a pdf, html, or Microsoft Word document—even a slideshow—at the click of a button.

  2. Embed R code into your report. When you render the file, R will run the code and insert its results into your report. Use this feature to add graphs and tables to your report: if your data ever changes, you can update your figures by re-rendering the report.

  3. Make interactive documents and slideshows. Your report becomes interactive when you embed Shiny code.

We've created a cheat sheet to help you master R Markdown. Download your copy [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/rm-cheatsheet.html).
