We are happy to announce a new series of tutorials that will take your Shiny apps to the next level. In the tutorials, Herman Sontrop and Erwin Schuijtvlot of [FRISS](http://www.friss.eu/en/) will teach you how to create custom JavaScript widgets and embed them into your Shiny apps.

The JavaScript language is a powerful tool when combined with Shiny.  You can use JavaScript code to create highly sophisticated actions, and the code can be run by your user's web browser. Best of all, JavaScript comes with a host of amazing visualization libraries that are ready to use out of the box, like [c3.js](http://c3js.org/), [d3.js](https://d3js.org/), [intro.js](http://introjs.com/) and more.

The [first tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/js-build-widget.html) is ready now, and we will publish each new lesson at the [Shiny Development Center](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/#extensions) as it becomes available.
