## Recurring Events

### Data Science Hangout

Last year, we started an informal "data science hangout" for the data science community to connect and chat about some of the more human-centric questions around data science leadership. These happen every Thursday at 12 ET with a different leader featured each week. 

The conversation is all audience-based and there's no registration needed, so you can jump on whenever it fits your schedule. Add the weekly hangouts to your calendar on <a href="https://www.addevent.com/event/Qv9211919" target = "_blank">AddEvent</a> and check out the new <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/data-science-hangout/" target = "_blank">website</a> with all the recordings.

### RStudio Enterprise Community Meetups

We also host industry meetups for teams to share the work they are doing within their organizations, teach lessons learned, and network with others. Join the group on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/RStudio-Enterprise-Community-Meetup/" target = "_blank">Meetup</a>.
