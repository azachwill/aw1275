We have renamed RStudio Server Pro to RStudio Workbench. This change reflects the product’s growing support for a wide range of different development environments. RStudio Workbench enables R and Python data scientists to use their preferred IDE in a secure, scalable, and collaborative environment--whether that is the RStudio IDE, JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebooks, or VS Code. We want RStudio Workbench to be the best single platform to support open source, code-first data science, whether your team is using R or Python. 

If you’d like to learn more about the reasons behind this name change, and what it might mean for you, please check out our <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500012472761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ here</a>, or set up a conversation with your customer success representative. 

We have also released new versions of the RStudio open source IDE, as well as RStudio Server Open Source and RStudio Desktop, and will share all the details in an upcoming post. Check out the <a href="/products/rstudio/release-notes/">release notes</a> if you'd like to know more now. **This release includes support for the latest version of R (4.1). If you wish to use R 4.1 with the RStudio IDE (whether open source or professional), you must upgrade to this release.**
