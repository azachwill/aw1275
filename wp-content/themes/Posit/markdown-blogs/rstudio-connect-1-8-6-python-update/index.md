## Bokeh and Streamlit support is now generally available

We are happy to announce that the newest interactive Python content types, Bokeh and Streamlit, are now generally available in RStudio Connect.

**Thank You!** to everyone who reached out to provide feedback on Bokeh and Streamlit during the Beta period. 

The RStudio Connect User Guide contains information about our support for Bokeh and Streamlit, including detailed deployment instructions, example applications, and known limitations/compatibility requirements for each framework:
