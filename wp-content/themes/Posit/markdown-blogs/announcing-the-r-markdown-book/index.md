It is exciting for us to see the amazing growth of the R Markdown ecosystem over the four years since the creation of R Markdown in 2014. Now you can author many types of documents, and build a wide range of applications based on R Markdown. As an effort to unite and improve the documentation of the R Markdown base package (**rmarkdown**) and several other extensions (such as **bookdown**, **blogdown**, **pkgdown**, **flexdashboard**, **tufte**, **xaringan**, **rticles**, and **learnr**) in one place, we authored a book titled "_R Markdown: The Definitive Guide_", which is to be published by Chapman & Hall/CRC in about two weeks.
