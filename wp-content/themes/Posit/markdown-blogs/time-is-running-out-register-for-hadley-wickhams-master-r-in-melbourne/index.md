Want to Master R? There's no better time or place than Hadley Wickham's workshop on December 12th and 13th at the Cliftons in Melbourne, VIC, Australia.

Register here: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/master-r-developer-workshop-melbourne-tickets-22546200292   (Note: Prices are in $US and VAT is not collected)

Discounts are still available for academics (students or faculty) and for 5 or more attendees from any organization. Email training@rstudio.com if you have any questions about the workshop that you don't find answered on the registration page.

Hadley has no Master R Workshops planned in the region for 2017 and his next one with availability won't be until September in San Francisco. If you've always wanted to take Master R but haven't found the time, Melbourne, [the second most fun city in the world](http://www.timeout.com/london/things-to-do/eighteen-cities-ranked-best-for-fun), is the place to go!

P.S. We've arranged a "happy hour" reception after class on Monday the 12th. Be sure to set aside an hour or so after the first day to talk to your classmates and Hadley about what's happening in R.
