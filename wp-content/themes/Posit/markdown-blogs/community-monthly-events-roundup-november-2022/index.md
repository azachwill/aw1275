### Data Science Hangout

The Data Science Hangout is a weekly, free-to-join open conversation for current and aspiring data science leaders to connect and chat about some of the more human-centric questions around data science leadership. These happen every Thursday at 12 ET with a different leader featured each week.

The conversation is all audience-based and you can jump on whenever it fits your schedule. Add the weekly hangouts <a href="https://www.addevent.com/event/Qv9211919" target = "_blank">to your calendar</a> and check out the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/data-science-hangout/" target = "_blank">website</a> with all the recordings.

A few other things:

* All are welcome - no matter your industry/experience
* No need to register for anything
* It's always okay to join for part of a session
* You can just listen-in if you want
* You can ask anonymous questions too!

### RStudio Enterprise Community Meetups

We also host industry meetups for teams to share the work they are doing within their organizations, teach lessons learned, and network with others. Join the group on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/RStudio-Enterprise-Community-Meetup/" target = "_blank">Meetup</a>.
