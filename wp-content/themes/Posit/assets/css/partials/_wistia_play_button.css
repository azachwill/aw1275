By default, wistia adds a mix-blend-mode: color to the play button
and that's causing the blur on nav-bar to behave odd.

Since we don't have full control on wistia styles, the fix (for now) is to
override the mix-blend-mode and add an opacity to the button background so it
stills shows part of the video-thumbnail through opacity.
