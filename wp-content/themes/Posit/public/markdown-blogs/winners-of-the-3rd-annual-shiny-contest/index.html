<p><img src="shiny-contest-hero-thin.jpg" alt="Shiny contest banner with confetti"></p>
<p>Once again the Shiny community has wowed us with their contributions to the 3rd annual Shiny Contest that we <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/03/11/time-to-shiny/">announced back in March 2021</a>.</p>
<p>We had 179 submissions from 164 unique Shiny developers to the contest this year over the two-month period submission period for the contest, with over 40% of participants indicating that they have less than one year experience with Shiny!</p>
<h1 id="evaluation-and-judging">Evaluation and judging</h1>
<p>Apps were evaluated based on technical merit and artistic achievement. Some apps excelled in one of these categories and some in the other, and some in both. Evaluation also took into account the narrative on the contest submission post on RStudio Community.</p>
<p>Before we go on to announcing the winners, we would like to thank our esteemed judges who helped us evaluate the submissions. A huge thanks to <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/csoneson" target="_blank">Charlotte Soneson</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/colin" target="_blank">Colin Fay</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/EconomiCurtis" target="_blank">Curtis Kephart</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/dgranjon" target="_blank">David Granjon</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/committedtotape" target="_blank">David Smale</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/rpodcast" target="_blank">Eric Nantz</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/federicomarini" target="_blank">Federico Marini</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/grrrck" target="_blank">Garrick Aden-Buie</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/rstudiojoe" target="_blank">Joe Rickert</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/johncoene" target="_blank">John Coene</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/kevinrue" target="_blank">Kevin Rue</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/kneijenhuijs" target="_blank">Koen Neijenhuijs</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/mayagans" target="_blank">Maya Gans</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/nsgrantham" target="_blank">Neal Grantham</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/nicohahn" target="_blank">Nico Hahn</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/pedrocoutinhosilva" target="_blank">Pedro Silva</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/rajk" target="_blank">Raj Kumar</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/parmsam" target="_blank">Sam Parmar</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/samanthatoet" target="_blank">Sam Toet</a>, and <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/winston" target="_blank">Winston Chang</a> for their help in evaluating the submissions and thoughtful comments.</p>

<p>All winners of the Shiny Contest 2021 will get one year of shinyapps.io Basic Plan, a bunch of hex stickers of RStudio packages, and a spot on the Shiny User Showcase. Runners up will additionally get any number of RStudio t-shirts, books, and mugs (worth up to $200) where mailing is possible. And, finally, grand prize winners will additionally receive special and persistent recognition by RStudio in the form of a winners page and a badge that will be publicly visible on their RStudio Community profile, as well as half-an-hour one-on-one with a representative from the RStudio Shiny team for Q&amp;A and feedback!</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are the winners! We have categorized runners up and grand prize winners based on whether they have less or more than one year experience with Shiny. Note that winners are listed in no specific order within each category.</p>
<h1 id="grand-prizes">Grand prizes</h1>
<h2 id="less-than-one-year-experience" class="anchored">Less than one year experience</h2>

<p>by <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/MargotBrd" target="_blank">Margot Brard</a></p>
<p><img src="images/wedding.gif" align="center" width="80%" alt="GIF of the wedding app that browses the wedding app and shows various screens of the app and the functionality like adding guests."></p>
<p>Guests can get logistical information about the wedding, confirm their attendance, and indicate their menu choice. The future bride and groom have access the wedding dashboard (visualization of expenses, number of confirmations, seating charts, ‚Ä¶). Read more about the app <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/wedding-a-shiny-app-to-help-future-grooms-shiny-contest-submission/104657" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The judges loved this novel approach to a very real problem (terrible wedding websites!) and especially enjoyed the table setting plans in the bride and groom only area.</p>
<h3 id="math-eagle-game" class="anchored">üèÜ <a href="https://sharukkhanstat777.shinyapps.io/MathEagleGame/" target="_blank">Math Eagle Game</a></h3>

Sidebar shows the answer status and the main panel shows the game where the eagle flies across the screen and the user needs to guess the right answer to the math question for the eagle to keep flying."></p>
<p>When the user clicks on START, the page directs to a mathematical game. The objective of the game is to make the math eagle reach outer space. For each correct or incorrect answer, the user is notified and the speed changes accordingly. After completing 2 minutes, the page directs to Scoreboard, where the player can view the scores as well as highlights. Read more about the app <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/math-eagle-game-shiny-contest-submission/104836" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The judges thought this was a very fun take on a math game for kids. They loved the technical implementation of this application with proper use of functions to reduce the codebase, and very proper use of reactivity and remarked that this was particularly impressive for someone relatively new to Shiny!</p>
<h3 id="shiny-app-for-climate-change-informed-tree-species-selection" class="anchored">üèÜ <a href="https://neoxone.shinyapps.io/BCGOV_CCISS" target="_blank">Shiny app for climate change informed tree species selection</a></h3>

<p>The judges thought the app showed high technical rigor, and especially highlighted that it‚Äôs structured as a package. Not only is the reactive functionality in the app is smooth, it‚Äôs also robust to errors with gentle fail mechanisms vs.&nbsp;crashing the app!</p>
<h2 id="more-than-one-year-experience" class="anchored">More than one year experience</h2>
<h3 id="racetrack-2-electric-boogaloo" class="anchored">üèÜ <a href="https://jpd527.shinyapps.io/racetrack/" target="_blank">Racetrack 2: Electric Boogaloo</a></h3>
