<p>It was the start of spring in 2019 and I was in my sophomore year of college. I had just finished up all my basic biology modules, but <strong>I knew the path of biology wasn’t for me</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s when I heard all about the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/06/07/2457482/0/en/With-27-5-CAGR-Healthcare-Analytics-Market-to-Surpass-Around-USD-80-21-Billion-by-2028.html" target="_blank">fast-growing</a> data science and healthcare analytics field. It sounded like a perfect blend of my two interests: biology and programming!</p>
<p><strong>And so my data science journey began…</strong></p>
<p>In this blog post, I’ll share my journey from studying biology to becoming a healthcare data analyst. I’ll also share some of the things I’ve learned along the way and practical steps on how you can make the transition into data science – if you’re not sure where to begin. Please check out this <a href="https://anyinstructor.com/recommended-resources/" target="_blank">resource guide</a> if you want more information on any of these steps.</p>
<h2 id="my-data-science-journey-from-biology-to-healthcare-analytics" class="anchored"><strong>My Data Science Journey from Biology to Healthcare Analytics</strong></h2>
<h3 id="familiarizing-with-data" class="anchored"><strong>1. Familiarizing With Data</strong></h3>
<p>My first taste of data analysis was when I got involved with analyzing web traffic data from a digital marketing internship. It was then that I realized that I really loved analyzing patterns!</p>
<p>With my newfound interest in data, I took things into my own hands to source the best learning resources in data and I wolfed down any helpful content I could find!</p>
<p><strong>Here are some of the types of free content I used (and still use to this day):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data analytics blogs</li>
<li>Data analytics YouTube channels</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there was one significant hurdle that was standing in my way – the <strong>huge skill gap</strong> between my basic knowledge and the data science field.</p>
<p>It was then that I knew what I had to overcome next. Based on all the free resources I found, I quickly realized that I had to build up data skills on essential technical tools as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some tools I found that were essential to a career in data science:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>R</li>
<li>Excel</li>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>Tableau</li>
</ul>
<p>Most sources online said that R programming was one of the key statistical languages used in biological research. With this knowledge, I formulated my next plan: to learn the R programming language.</p>
<h4 id="what-i-learned" class="anchored"><strong>What I Learned:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Identify areas/tools/skills to learn</strong> – and follow them up with a clear action plan. Tackle each of them one by one, based on existing experiences you’ve had.</p>
<h3 id="learning-programming" class="anchored"><strong>2. Learning Programming</strong></h3>
<p>This was the toughest uphill battle I had before entering data science.</p>
<p>Just like any other person without coding experience, I was stumped on where to begin. I tried out several free online courses on R but soon gave up because they were just too tough for an introduction.</p>
<p>This was when I stumbled upon a “Data Analyst in R” boot camp within my local area! It was summer break and I signed myself up immediately.</p>
<p>This boot camp covered several key topics I wanted to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic programming</li>
<li>Using <code>apply()</code> functions in R</li>
<li>Using the tidyverse packages</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the skills taught were using RStudio Desktop, which has been the industry-standard R IDE. The built-in integrations to CRAN help documentation plus having the ability to view my environment variables at a glance were a major help to my learning.</p>
<p>To accelerate my learning, I also concurrently took on a <strong>biomedical data science research internship</strong> at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I combined my experience in biology with my (newfound) R programming skills to work on a research project on schizophrenia.</p>
<p><strong>This was a major breakthrough for me!</strong></p>
<p>Through the course of the internship, I picked up an essential biological data analysis package – <a href="https://bioconductor.org/" target="_blank">Bioconductor</a>. To better show my data and code, I also learned R Markdown for my project presentations.</p>

<i>

I used the rmdformats package to create a nice markdown presentation for my code

</i>
</center>
<p>Although I knew a little more about R and the associated packages it has, I still hungered for more: to go deeper as well as explore other tools in data science.</p>

<h4 id="what-i-learned-1" class="anchored"><strong>What I Learned:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Having a basic understanding of technical skills is very important</strong>, especially in a tech role in data analytics. Taking boot camps or courses can help lay a good foundation for you while you develop your knowledge. These foundations will provide a good platform for you to build your skills.</p>
<p>Coding practice platforms like <a href="https://www.stratascratch.com/" target="_blank">StrataScratch’s practice questions</a> and <a href="https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/" target="_blank">Mode’s SQL tutorials</a> are among the few I’ve tried and found to be very helpful!</p>
<h3 id="adapting-my-learning-to-data-science" class="anchored"><strong>3. Adapting My Learning to Data Science</strong></h3>
<p>My next focus was to gain as much exposure to data science as possible, even while taking my biology major! I took on a module, “Data Science for Biologists”, where I learned biostatistics and introductory machine learning.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, there’s more R programming along with it!</strong></p>
<p>And through the course of that college semester, I worked on several data science projects that boosted my confidence in R. I learned more about data visualization and writing simple Protein Motif Search algorithms.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/image3.png" alt="R Markdown website on Data Science for Biologists Individual Essay" width="90%">
</center>

I used R Markdown for one of the essay assignments in the module

</i>
</center>
<p>In addition, I ended that module with a final project on machine learning in another programming language I’ve always wanted to try –– Python. My project mates and I created a simple recommender model using Spotify data for our final project.</p>
<center>

</center>
<center>

I used K-Nearest Neighbors to predict recommended songs based on genre

</i>
</center>
<p>Shortly after I entered the world of Python, I soon realized that Excel was an equally important tool that I had to master for my portfolio, even if I wasn’t planning to get into data analytics.</p>
<p>Therefore, in my next <strong>medical services internship</strong>, I created a project using Google Sheets (similar to Excel) to manage inventory!</p>
<p>By this point, I was pretty sure that an analytics job would be the path I wanted to take. With my knowledge of biology, I naturally looked for opportunities in healthcare, especially since the pandemic had just hit the world.</p>
<h4 id="what-i-learned-2" class="anchored"><strong>What I Learned:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Keep learning and advancing your skillset</strong> – whether through online courses, certificates, or simply reading data science articles online.</p>
<p>The field is ever-changing – so it’s crucial to educate yourself continuously. Make sure you <a href="https://justjooz.com/best-artificial-intelligence-certifications/" target="_blank">keep learning</a> about machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Apprenticeships are also a good idea since they provide a comprehensive education compared to shorter, cheaper courses.</p>
<h3 id="exploring-healthcare-analytics" class="anchored"><strong>4. Exploring Healthcare Analytics</strong></h3>
<p>My next step in this data science journey is another crucial one – a <strong>data analytics internship</strong> at a health-tech startup! During my internship, I picked up more tools for my data stack, such as Python, Excel, SQL, Tableau, and NoSQL databases.</p>
<p>At the same time, I also started <strong>documenting my learnings</strong> from all the various data analytics skills on my blog, <a href="https://anyinstructor.com/" target="_blank">Any Instructor</a>. I also explored bioinformatics modules within my course to learn more tools like Bash and R.</p>
<p>While I tackled daily tasks at my internship, I decided to hone my skills further by registering for online certificates like the <a href="https://grow.google/certificates/data-analytics/#?modal_active=none" target="_blank">Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate</a>. This certificate wasn’t easy, but it taught me more than just technical skills in R and SQL, but also how to process and present data to stakeholders well.</p>
<p><strong>All that effort wasn’t for nothing, though!</strong></p>
<p>Through my past internships and projects in data mining, I landed a full-time healthcare data analyst position at my internship placement company! During my work as a data analyst, my Python programming proficiency increased rapidly from all the projects I was given.</p>
<p>I later on also moved on to a bioinformatics data science position, where I worked on large biological datasets for eye research. This was where I challenged myself with learning more bioinformatics R packages while applying machine learning to protein data.</p>
<h4 id="what-i-learned-3" class="anchored"><strong>What I Learned:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Explore your interest in the data science field that works for you!</strong> Mine may be healthcare analytics but there are many other data science niches out there that you can consider exploring, such as <a href="https://dashthis.com/blog/8-marketing-analytics-platforms-to-simplify-your-data-analysis-processes/" target="_blank">marketing analytics</a> and finance.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure about what area you want to focus on, take on as many projects and internships as possible to gain more exposure! You’ll never know until you try.</p>
<h3 id="giving-back-to-the-community" class="anchored"><strong>5. Giving Back to the Community</strong></h3>
<p>If there’s one thing that will really help in your own data science journey, it would be by <strong>creating content to give back to the community</strong>. You have no idea how much I’ve gained just from contributing back!</p>
<p>I started getting onto LinkedIn groups to share my experiences with fellow data science enthusiasts. The process of interviewing for data analyst and data scientist roles wasn’t easy and I was glad to share my advice with them.</p>
<p>With the same desire to help others, I moved on to <strong>giving workshops</strong> on various topics in data while writing helpful content on my blog to data science learners (who were just like me 3 years ago!).</p>

<p>Helping others through blogging has really helped me too, as it allows me to <strong>keep my skills sharp</strong> while also meeting new friends in the data science community. This blog post is another great example!</p>
<h4 id="what-i-learned-4" class="anchored"><strong>What I Learned:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Don’t forget to give back to the community</strong> once in a while. It can be through simple things like answering questions on Quora or LinkedIn or conducting workshops for beginners. We all have to start somewhere and your effort will definitely be appreciated!</p>
<p>You can start by <strong>documenting your learning journey</strong>! It helps to have a portfolio of past projects and work experiences to show when you’re job hunting or networking with people in the industry. Writing a blog or on any online data science platform can really help with that.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up" class="anchored"><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h2>
<p>That’s pretty much my story on how I went from a <strong>biology student to a healthcare data analyst to a bioinformatics data scientist</strong>. It hasn’t been an easy journey so far, but it’s definitely been a fun and rewarding one (and it has only just begun)!</p>
<p><strong>To sum up my data science journey, here are the key lessons I learned along the stages:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Identify key skills and have a clear action plan</li>
<li>Master the basics of programming</li>
<li>Keep learning and advancing your skillset</li>
<li>Explore your interest in data science</li>
<li>Give back to the community</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m still learning new things every day and I hope my story has inspired you to start your own data science journey! If you have any questions, feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-chia/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing that I want you to take away from this story, it’s that your data science journey is what <strong>YOU</strong> make of it. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution and the best way to learn is by doing. So go out there and create something amazing!</p>
